## Iteration 1 | The rover object
- Create object (direction)


## Iteration 2 | Turning the rover
- turnLeft()
- turnRight()

-- Suggested approach: Begin with a switch statement.


## Iteration 3 | Moving the rover
- add properties 'x' and 'y'
- moveForward()


## Iteration 4 | Commands
- Create a function that receives a list of commands. (e.g. 'rffrfflfrff'.)
- Suggested approach:
  - Use a loop to iterate over the string. 
  - Inside this loop, write a switch or if statement to call the correct function. 


## Iteration 5 | Tracking
- create the property 'travelLog' (array)
- After each move, push the coordinates of the previous place where the rover was to the travelLog array. 
- After the rover has finished its moves, print out all of the places the rover has traveled over.
