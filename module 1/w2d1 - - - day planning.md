<!-- 
  @Luis: 
  - day is heavy (and, on top of that, it's monday)
  - move some contents to w1d5 or w2d2 ?
-->


 IMPORTANT: Contents heavy + LAB really demanding = focus on fundamentals.


 Planning:
  - LAB Q&A (short)
  - JS functions [3h] -- `focus!!`
  - Arrays: map, reduce, filter [2h] -- `focus!!`
  - Arrays: sort and reverse -- self guided


- Make sure to kick-off lab very early.
  - REMEMBER: lab is very demanding !!
