- 11h code freeze
  - Full test on production (test all the functionality)

## Task: Getting Familiar with React


<!--

@Luis

feb 2023: i've added a unit on w7d1.

-->


Task: 
  - Watch the first 46min. of this video: https://youtu.be/jLS0TkAHvRg

Goal: 
  - Start getting familiar with some React concepts (learning React is challenging).

Notes:
  - You don't need to go further that minute 46 (but, if you want, you can watch those 46 minutes 2 times).
  - You don't need to install Node (we already have it installed).
  - You don't need to understand everything (we will be covering all those concepts from the beginning).


The following concepts are specially relevant:
  - Components (what is a component, how we can create a component)
  - Props (what are props, how we pass & use props)
  - State (what is state, how we can use it)
