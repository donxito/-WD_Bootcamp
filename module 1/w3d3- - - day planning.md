## Deployment
- intro deployment
  - what it is? process to make our software available for users
  - dev vs. production environments
  - other environments:

- m1 deployment: 
  - github pages
  - m1 vs other modules: deployment will be much easier today

- deploy game (github pages)

- explain that `index.html` will be the entry point.
  - example 1: index.html - gameover.html
  - example 2: index.html - game.html - gameover.html

- add image
  - start with absolute path (will work on localhost but fail on GH pages)
  - show how commit & push will be reflected live
  - see how it fails on production + explain cache
  - fix using relative path.


- common pain points:
  - index.html (should be your initial page)
  - relative paths
  - cache
  - case-sensitive on github

<!-- @todo: create slides deployment m1 -->


- fix bugs (ex. images, css or js not loaded).


- intro git branches (see `extra - git branches.md`)
  - note: do just a quick demo on a visual tool (it can be a bit too early to introduce branches)


- Readme file: add link to deployment (so that anyone can test your game)
