# LAB - JavaScript Vikings


Encourage students to do Bonus iterations (4 & 5), this is when things get interesting.



TIPS:

- Iteration 2:
  - Inheritance (extends) +++
  - super() +++
  - polymorphism +++
    - note: a Viking extends `Soldier` but implements a different method `receiveDamage()`

- IMPORTANT: Pay attention to the instructions and tests.
  - eg. "A Saxon has received DAMAGE points of damage"
  > `A Saxon has received ${damage} points of damage`



- BONUS - Iteration 4: War

- BONUS - Iteration 5 (reuse code)
  - create a generic method (ex. `attack()`)
  - call that generic method from `vikingAttack()` and `saxonAttack()`.
