# LAB - CSS Flexbox Slack

Notes:
- students find it challenging + takes a lot of time
  (with 1h during class, students can not make much progress)
- can make it "bonus"
- ask them to focus only on a specific part (ex. only the top part with header, main image, paragraph and blue button)
  - (leave the hamburger menu, footer etc.)
