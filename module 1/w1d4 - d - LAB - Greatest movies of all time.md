# LAB - Greatest movies of all time


Notes: 
- students find this LAB specially challenging (after a challenging day)
  - example: "I worked 3hours non-stop." (Dominika)


- They can do iterations 1-4

- Iteration 5 (challenging): 
  - sort() 
  - how to copy arrays (so that they don't mutate the orignal array)
    - Tell students to google and/or check self-guided "Js | Value vs Reference"
