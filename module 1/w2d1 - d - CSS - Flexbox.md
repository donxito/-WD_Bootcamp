## Intro

- Evolution of CSS layouts: 
  - tables (still used in email)
  - floats
  - css frameworks
  - flexbox
  - grid.



- CSS support: https://caniuse.com

- Flexible Box Module (aka. "Flexbox")

- Flexbox: one dimension (deals with layout in one dimension at a time - either as a row or as a column)



## The 2 axes of flexbox

- main axis + cross axis

- main axis is defined by `flex-direction`

- possible values:

    ```
    flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse
    ```

- diagrams of the different directions/axis: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox#the_main_axis
