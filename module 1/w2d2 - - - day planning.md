<!-- 

best option is do one of these 2 labs together:
- "lab ironhack cart" OR "chronometer iterations 2, 3, 4" 


chronometer:
- quite long and heavy (students are tired by this point & the lab is long)
- try to give them guidance/support before & during the lab

-->


DOM manipulation:
- can be good to prepare a short, easy exercise to practice.

LAB "ironhack cart"
- if we do it during class time, most students don't have time to finish (working in pairs, in 1.5h the usually do iterations 1 and 2, possibly with help).
- instead, consider doing it together with LT (or in small groups with TAs), so that they have a feeling that we finish it.
- that will also leave more time to start "chronometer" iterations 2,3,4


TESTING (lesson and lab):
- if we are short of time, can be self-guided / extra
