4. Advice:

- Start from very simple --> MVP
  - How:
    - 1) Plan for the most basic functionality.
    - 2) Focus on the minimum requirements
    - 3) Once you have an MVP, add improvements
  - Why:
    - time is limited.
    - you don't want to take risk your project.

- UX: 
  - Images, etc: find resources on the internet (eg. canva.com)

  - A game has to be fun to play, that's the most important thing 

- Development: 
  - START FROM THE LOGIC & FUNCTIONALITY (UX improvements at the end)
