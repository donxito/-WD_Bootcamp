# Project 1 Guidelines (project 1 kick-off)


1. Go through lesson "Project #1 Guidelines"
- project requirements etc
  - IMPORTANT: plain JavaScript


2. Share/Show examples of games from other students
  - Why: we can think, how would I build it etc.
    - example: water sort puzzle game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbN0Y0KDqDU
  
  
  - Example: TETRIS game
    - Simplifications for version 1 (focus on an MVP):
      - Same shape (ex. 2x2 boxes)
      - Not clearing lines (ie. in the first version, we never remove blocks)

  - Example 2: quertygame

4. Advice:

- Start from very simple --> MVP
  - How:
    - 1) Plan for the most basic functionality.
    - 2) Focus on the minimum requirements
    - 3) Once you have an MVP, add improvements
  - Why:
    - time is limited.
    - you don't want to take risk your project.

- UX: 
  - Images, etc: find resources on the internet (eg. canva.com)

  - A game has to be fun to play, that's the most important thing 

- Development: 
  - START FROM THE LOGIC & FUNCTIONALITY (UX improvements at the end)
