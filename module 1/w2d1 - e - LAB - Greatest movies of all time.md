IMPORTANT: 

- Tell them to do, at least, iterations 1-4.

- Iteration 5 (challenging):
  - how to copy arrays (so that they don't mutate the orignal array)
    - Tell students to google and/or check self-guided "Js | Value vs Reference"
  - sort() 


  ```js
  const original = [2, 3, 4];
  const copy = [...original];
  ```

## Concepts:

- Iteration 1:
  - `.map()` through an array of objects

- Iteration 2:
  - `.filter()` an array of objects

- Iteration 3:
  - `.reduce()` an array of objects
  - note: score must be returned rounded to 2 decimals: do some research

- Iteration 4:
  - `.filter()` + `.reduce()` an array of objects
  - note: score must be returned rounded to 2 decimals: do some research


- Iteration 5:
  - copy an array
    - IMPORTANT: make sure this is explained !!
    <!-- - IMPORTANT: make sure this is explained !! -->
  - `.sort()` an array of objects


- Iteration 6:
  - Can be solved using a combination of: `.map()`, `.sort()` and `.slice()`.


- (bonus) Iteration 7: Time format

- (bonus) Iteration 8: Best yearly score average
