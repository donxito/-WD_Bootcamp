# Day Planning 

- (skip) Questions yesterday's LAB? [30m]
  - LAB "Flexbox Slack": demo with logos (airbnb, spotify, etc)
    - images (sizes, ratios)
    - flexbox (row + flex-wrap)
    - media queries

- (skip) Quick refresh from yesterday [20m]
  - Can also do a quick demo with html + css (list of 5 products, using flexbox)

- Slides: Bootcamp Intro III [10m]
- JS Intro [1h]
- JS Data Types - numbers and strings [2h]
- JS Data Types in JavaScript - boolean, undefined & null [1h]



## Active Learning

- (self-guided) JS Numbers - Advanced Topics [30m]
- (individual) LAB | JS Data Types
- (in pairs) LAB | JavaScript Basic Algorithms

bonus:
  - Learn about binary (7min. video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xpk67YzOn5w
  - Once you're familiar with binary, you can try to solve this exercise: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1of_BBdH5WdXvfC45tomZ8hgBDOXvEa_q/view?usp=drive_link

<!-- @LT: students find workload relatively light today -->

<!-- 
@todo: add further iterations to today's labs:
- e.g. create a function that takes a string in binary and returns it's decimal value (note: we still haven't seen functions but the function declaration can be given) + research / watch a video on "binary"
-->

(bonus) LAB | JS Strings Cardio
https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-js-strings-cardio
