## Flexbox Exercises

- A: Responsive Navigation Menu:
  - Replicate this layout (note, it is responsive): https://codepen.io/team/css-tricks/full/YqaKYR
  - Note to students: 
    - focus on the distrubution of the elements (main goal is to practice flexbox; do not worry about details of the design, colors etc)
    - to simplify: we can target mobile + desktop only (1 breakpoint)
