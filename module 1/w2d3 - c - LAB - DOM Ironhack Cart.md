# LAB - DOM Ironhack Cart

<!--- 

How: 
- work in Pairs


Notes:
  - students find it very difficult (even iterations 1-2-3) 
  - lab kick-off: show how to solve iteration 1

--->



Explain:
- events & add addEventListener
  - (there's already boilerplate code for events in the initial code)
- inputElm.value

Things they will need:

- elm.querySelector()
- elm.querySelectorAll()
- elm.innerHTML
- elm.value
- (elm.textContent)

- iterate through a collection of dom elements
  - note: it can be a "NodeList" or an "HTML Collection"
  - research or check students portal to know how to iterate on each case.

- other things they may need (research or check students portal):
  - remove dom elements
  - add dom elements
