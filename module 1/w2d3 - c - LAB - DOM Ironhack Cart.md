# LAB - DOM Ironhack Cart

<!--- 

@Luis:
- live demo (there's a bug when you add new products): file:///C:/Luis/pro/Ironhack/labs/labs-further-solutions/m1-ironhack-cart-zhenni/lab-dom-ironhack-cart/index.html



Notes:
  - students find it very difficult (even iteration 1) -> solve together in class (eg. 1-3)


--->

Explain:
- events & add addEventListener
  - (there's already boilerplate code for events in the initial code)
- inputElm.value

Things they will need:

- elm.querySelector()
- elm.querySelectorAll()
- elm.innerHTML
- elm.value
- (elm.textContent)

- iterate through a collection of dom elements
  - note: it can be a "NodeList" or an "HTML Collection"
  - research or check students portal to know how to iterate on each case.

- other things they may need (research or check students portal):
  - remove dom elements
  - add dom elements
