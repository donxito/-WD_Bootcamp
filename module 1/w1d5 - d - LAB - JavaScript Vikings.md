# LAB - JavaScript Vikings

LAB applies OOP & ES6 classes


TIPS:

- Iteration 2:
  - Inheritance (extends) +++
  - super() +++
  - polymorphism +++
    - note: a Viking extends `Soldier` but implements a different method `receiveDamage()`

- Pay attention to the instructions and tests.
  - eg. "A Saxon has received DAMAGE points of damage"
  > `A Saxon has received ${damage} points of damage`
