## Explain:

- how we work with labs in general (DO THE FIRST ITERATION & ONE COMMIT TO SHOW THEM)
  - Fork
  - Clone
    - remember to clone the lab you forked (not the original one)
    - keep things organized (computer > ironhack > week1 )
  - Git essentials
    - add, commit, push (they're explained in the lab instructions)
  - Create PR
  - Submit the LAB (sending the link on the students portal)

- repl.it (online editor)
  - it is suggested in the instructions of the lab, so that students can test their code
  - you can use  repl.it, stackblitz or any other editor
