## Intro from PMs (30min.)


## (skip) Icebreaker activity (30min.)

  <!-- 
  
  @todo: 
  - simplify this a lot (some students may find this overwhelming, especially the network panel)
  - alternative: show the dev tools while we do a codealong (code much more simple)
  

  Demo:
  - ironhack.com: "WebDev Bootcamp starting today"

  Quick exercise: what headline would you like to see today in the news?
  - "World leaders agree to stop fighting each other and start fighting climate change"
  - share your screenshots in #random

## html + css (follow .md files)
  - HTML (project setup + html intro + shortcuts) [1h]

Notes:
- Students know all the theory 
- Instead, build something together
- Opportunity to speak about good practices & common mistakes
- Example. ![css exercise](../media/images/w1d3-css-exercise.png)
