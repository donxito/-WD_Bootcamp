IMPORTANT: 
- with the new prework, students are well prepared
- they will find the content (variables, Data Types, loops) repetitive

@LT:
- check briefly the contents they see in prework
- Do coding instead of lecture (eg. solve exercise + take it as an excuse to introduce all those concepts).
- (extra): include Date & some examples
