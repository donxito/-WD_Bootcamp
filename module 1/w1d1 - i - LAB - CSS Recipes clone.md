# LAB - CSS Recipes clone

<!--- 

Status: draft

How: individual

--->

Notes to TA/LT:
- demo how to work with labs (fork, clone...)
- ask students to create a directory "module1" and keep things organized


Notes to students:
- not responsive (desktop only)


Content:
- text is already provided in the html (don't need to type it)
- images are also provided in a directory "images"

CSS:
- don't forget to link to the css file from your html:
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`

Recipe info (time that it takes to cook, servings, cals):
- To simplify, images are provided (see directory images)
- Note: this is not the best practice (usually, we want to add this content as text).

Main title alignment
- we need to align horizontal + vertically
- do some research




## Explain:

- how we work with labs in general (DO THE FIRST ITERATION & ONE COMMIT TO SHOW THEM)
  - Fork
  - Clone
    - remember to clone the lab you forked (not the original one)
    - keep things organized (computer > ironhack > week1 )
  - Git essentials
    - add, commit, push (they're explained in the lab instructions)
  - Create PR
  - Submit the LAB (sending the link on the students portal)
    - Submit by 9am
