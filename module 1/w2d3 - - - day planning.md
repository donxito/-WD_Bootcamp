<!-- 

Update: do most of the content self-guided

Old planning (guided):
- DOM manipulation: methods & properties [2.5h]
- DOM manipulation: create DOM node [0.5h]
- DOM manipulation: events [1.5h]
- (skip) DOM manipulation: inputs [0.5h?]

 -->


## Planning

- LAB review

- (Project 1 examples)

- Refresh from previous day
  - value vs. reference
  - implications (ex.: comparing 2 arrays with the same contents)
  - how to copy arrays / objects

- Self-guided: DOM (details below) [2.5h]

- Group session: Q&A + create DOM element + JS Events (details below)

- LAB "DOM + OOP Memory Card Game" -- In pairs





## Self-guided DOM:

Follow these 2 units (code along & practice with the code):
- DOM | Introduction & Selectors (all contents)
- DOM | Manipulation (`until the section "Events in JavaScript elements"`)

Bonus:
- If you finish, you can continue with the section "Events in JavaScript elements"
- Or try the bonus lab "LAB | JavaScript Advanced Algorithms" (w2d1)

How: work in pairs

Time: 2.5h




## Group session: Q&A + create DOM element + JS Events

- Note: 
  - you don't need to memorize all this (just be familiar with it)
  - in m2, React will do dom manipulation for us

- Q&A

- Refresh: how to create a DOM element
  - Demo: create an image & append to the dom
    <!-- 
    @LT: 
    - prepare a blank project for the demo (blank html + css + js)
    - students can code in the project the did as self-guided
    -->

- Explain: JS Events
  - Follow notes in "w2d3 - b - DOM - Manipulation.md"
  - Final result: https://github.com/ironhack-fulltime-degenerates-oct2023/dom-manipulation-practice/blob/main/index.js
