<!--

DOM manipulation: 
- the day is VERY demanding (and overwhelming) for most students

-->


## Quick Warmup (refresh from previous day)

- setTimeout with timer zero (remember to fork)
  <!-- @Luis: remember to fork!  -->
  https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-kyccls?file=index.js
  - start with a timeout 1000ms
  - then change to 0ms
  - then uncomment the interval

- ALTERNATIVE: ask if students have questions from chronometer lab.



## Contents


DOM manipulation:
- can be good to prepare a short, easy exercise to practice.


LAB "ironhack cart" -- DO IT IN PAIRS
  - option 1: in PAIRS
  - option 2: solve iteration 1 in main room
    - time estimation (solving together in class): iteration 1 - 90min. 
  - option 3: together (with LT) or small groups (with TAs)


  - Time:
    - As reference: working in pairs, in 1.5h they usually do iterations 1 and 2, possibly with help.
    - instead, consider doing it together with LT (or in small groups with TAs), so that they have a feeling that we finish it.
