<!--

DOM manipulation: 
- the day is VERY demanding (and overwhelming) for most students
- we see a lot of methods & properties.
- tell students they don't need to memorize all (just make sure to understand & be familiar with it).

-->


## Quick Warmup (refresh from previous day)

- setTimeout with timer zero (remember to fork)
  <!-- @Luis: remember to fork!  -->
  https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-kyccls?file=index.js
  - start with a timeout 1000ms
  - then change to 0ms
  - then uncomment the interval


## Planning

- LAB review
- Project 1 examples

- DOM manipulation: methods & properties [2.5h]
- DOM manipulation: create DOM node [0.5h]
- DOM manipulation: events [1.5h]
- (skip) DOM manipulation: inputs [0.5h?]

- LAB "DOM + OOP Memory Card Game" -- In pairs
