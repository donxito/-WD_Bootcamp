@Luis:
- today there's less contents but monday will be heavy.
- try to introduce some of those contents from monday. For example:
  - `setTimout()` and `setInterval()`
- best option is to do that in the morning, so that we can then move to OOP concepts (that's what they'll need for the lab)

- IMPORTANT: do NOT introduce arrow functions today (the may have a hard time with `this`).
