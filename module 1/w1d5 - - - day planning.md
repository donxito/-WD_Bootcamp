@Luis:
- today there's less contents but monday will be heavy.
- try to introduce some of those contents from monday. For example:
  - `setTimout()` and `setInterval()`
- best option is to do that in the morning, so that we can then move to OOP concepts (that's what they'll need for the lab)

- IMPORTANT: do NOT introduce arrow functions today (the may have a hard time with `this`).

-->



Morning:
- Questions from lab (30m.)
- introduce callback & anonymous functions (do example with forEach) (30min.)
- (extra) introduce setTimeout/setInterval (30min.)
- OOP: intro + oop with plain objects
- OOP: ES6 Classes + CFU
- OOP: OOP Bakery exercise (30min.)



Afternoon:

- Retrospective

- Icebreakers
