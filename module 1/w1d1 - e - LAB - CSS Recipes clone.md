# LAB - CSS Recipes clone

<!--- 

Status: draft

--->

Notes to TA/LT:
- demo how to work with labs (fork, clone...)
- ask students to create a directory "module1" and keep things organized


Notes to students:
- not responsive (desktop only)


Content:
- text is already provided in the html (don't need to type it)
- images are also provided in a directory "images"

CSS:
- don't forget to link to the css file from your html:
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />`

Recipe info (time that it takes to cook, servings, cals):
- To simplify, images are provided (see directory images)
- Note: this is not the best practice (usually, we want to add this content as text).

Main title alignment
- we need to align horizontal + vertically
- do some research
