## Positioning

Static
  - default

Relative

Fixed

Absolute

Sticky (currently missing in the students portal)
  - A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.





## Floats

Tell students to skip this part.

- in the old days it was used for layouts
- nowadays it just makes sense to use float if you need to wrap text around images
