# HTML - Introduction

<!-- 
Status: just some notes

Recommendation: veeery brief (mention just the basics)
-->


Steps to follow:

- (done) What is HTML

- (done) How to see the HTML of a website (browser > view source)

- (done) Dev Tools: elements panel
  - Explain the DOM (Document Object Model)
    - Tree of Nodes
    - In the HTML DOM, everything is a node

- Creating HTML
  - Demo on Codepen/Stackblitz
  - Demo on VS Code

# Inital Setup

  <!-- @todo: create list/gist with the steps to follow -->

  - Open a new VS Code Window

  - Open the terminal (View > Terminal)

  - IMPORTANT: if you use Windows, make sure you're not using Poweshell (you can use `Git Bash` instead)

    <!-- 
      
    Windows users
    - click on the little triangle
    - Select default profile
    - Click "git bash"
    - type "exit" in the terminal
    - open it again (View > Terminal)
    
    -->

  - Navigavigate to the directory where you will work.
    - `cd xxx`
    - `cd ..`

  - create a directry for ironhack (if you don't have it yet): ex. `mkdir ironhack` + enter into that directory `cd ironhack`

  - Create a directory for module 1: `mkdir module1` + enter into that directory `cd module1`

  - Create a directory for this exercise: `mkdir html-intro` + enter into that directory `cd html-intro`

  - Create file: `touch index.html`

  - Open with VS Code: `code .`


<!--

@todo:
- create cheatsheet Unix commands
- some examples: see prework

-->


- From here, follow students portal 
  - (from the place where it explains "DOCTYPE Indicates that the markup language for your document content is HTML5.")



- HTML structure (DOCTYPE etc)
  - note: use emmet abreviation `!`
- Create an h1
- Install "Live server" extension + open in browser
- IMPORTANT: Block vs. inline
  - ex. div vs. span
- Examples of block elements (see students portal: "HTML Block-level elements cheat sheet")
- Examples of inline elements (see students portal: "HTML Inline elements cheat sheet")
- Semantics 
  - ex. difference section vs. div
- Self-closing tags (ex. hr)
- HTML DOM tree (See it in the dev tools)
  - DOM tree Diagram: https://i.imgur.com/m08deQC.png


- IMPORTANT:
  - when creating your projects, start from the HTML.


- (brief) Some Emet shortcuts

  ```
  div>p*3

  div.container

  div#recipes
  ```
