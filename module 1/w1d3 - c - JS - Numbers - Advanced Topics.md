Self-guided (25-40min.)

Bonus:
- create a function that generates a random number between 2 values
- (you may need to do some research)

ex. 

    ```js

    function generateRandomInInterval(a, b){
        //generate a random number between "a" and "b"
    }

    generateRandomInInterval(0, 10); //generate a random number between 0 and 10
    generateRandomInInterval(20, 25); //generate a random number between 20 and 25

    ```
