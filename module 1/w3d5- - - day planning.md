## Friday (presentation day)


- First thing in the morning: 
  - ask students to submit urls in the students portal (repo + github pages)



- 11h code freeze
  - Full test on production (test all the functionality)
  - From that moment on, we should NOT make further changes on production.
  - All working fine ? Drop a line to your TA "all working fine, I don't make further changes on production"
  - Critical bugs or problems ? Pls report by 11:30h.



<!--


@Luis: share a few minutes before presentation.

Remember:
- keep it brief (5min.)
- show demo on production
- if you have sound, share with sound
- most important: enjoy the presentation!!
