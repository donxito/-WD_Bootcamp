# JS - Arrays & Objects

<!--- 
Status: draft
-->



## Data structures
- The better we can organize our data --> the better we can represent reallity --> the better our code


- Examples:
	const employees = ["Alice", "Bob"]

	const company = { title: "abc", location: "" }




## Nested data structures:

- object that includes an array

  ```
  const user = {
    name: "alice",
    friends: ["bob", "charly", "elvis"]
  }
  ```

- object that includes an object --eg. company with address

- array of arrays (aka. "two-dimensional array") -- eg: array of classes -- each class is an array of student names

- array of objects -- eg: array of students



## Reading data from nested data structures
- practice

## Updating data
- practice

## Adding data
- practice: add a new element at the end of the last class (push)


## Check for understanding
- Create
  - company: name of company + location + year it was created
  - the company has 2 products (each product has product name + price)
  - the company has 3 employees (name + age + hobbies)
- Read: name & price of the first product
- Update: age of this 2nd employee
- Add: new employee
