## Transitions vs Animations

- Transitions:
  - Can only move from initial to final state â€” no intermediate steps
  - Can only run once
  - Require a trigger to run (like mouse hover)

- Animations:
  - Can have intermediate steps in between
  - Can loop infinitely
  - Can be triggered but can also run automatically
