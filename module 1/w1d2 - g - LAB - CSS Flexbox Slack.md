How: work in pairs



Notes to students:
- Before you start, have a quick look at the whole final result
- Focus on practicing the concepts we've seen today (media queries, flexbox)
- Leave low level details as a bonus (ex. font-family, font-size, text color....)
- Mobile Hamburguer menu: BONUS (doesn't need to work).
- Footer: BONUS
