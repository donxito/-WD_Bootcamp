Notes:
- We will work on the app "popcorn-time" we created the day before
- React Forms can take much longer than it seems (about 4h)

-->


Popcorn Time II:
- Display number of movies in the header (Lifting state up)
- extract Controls to a specific component (communication child-parent, now we need to pass a callback to the child component) 
- functionality to filter based on minRating (passing arguments in the callback)
- functionality to add movies (Step 1: form with 1 field)
- functionality to add movies (Step 2: form with multiple fields)
- functionality to add movies (Step 3: extract to a separate component)
- (extra) Handling multiple inputs with a single method
