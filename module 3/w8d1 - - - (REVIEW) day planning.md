  - How we implement CRUD
    - Model
    - Routes
      - one file per resource
      - rest patterns
      - example: GET /events, POST /events
      - think together post request
  - Authentication
    - Signup / Register
      - similar to "Create" but we need to create hash
    - Login
    - Verify
  - Protected routes
