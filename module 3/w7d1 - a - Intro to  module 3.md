  - CRUD (https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/14qn9kxx3beofvs15h2q.png)


- See sample project:
  - https://meet-them-all.netlify.app
  - On that example, see how it works as an SPA (React)



- 1.5 weeks content + 1.5 weeks projects



- Mini-project
  - build REST API


- Project 3: in pairs.
  - Why: in almost any company, you'll be working in a team with other developers

    <!--
    
    Note: 
    - if a student is falling behind in labs or requirements to graduate, we may ask them to do project 3 individual.
      - reason: learn fundamentals + proove that you have a minimum level to graduate.
    - when this is the case, we contact them before we start project 3 (we still have quite a few labs).
