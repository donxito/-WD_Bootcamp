  - Mention: it's a React app + connects to a backend API


- 1.5 weeks content + 1.5 weeks projects



- Mini-project

- Project 3: in pairs.
  - Why: in almost any company, you'll be working in a team with other developers

    <!--
    
    Note: 
    - if a student is falling behind in labs or requirements to graduate, we may ask them to do project 3 individual.
      - reason: learn fundamentals + prove that you have a minimum level to graduate.
    - when this is the case, we contact them before we start project 3 (we still have quite a few labs).

    <!-- @todo: include the notes above in the slides (labs, project etc) -->
