## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

Give feedback to students (ex. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

-->





## Planning

- Intro to module 3 (see .md file) [30min]

- (optional) Day Intro (explain what we will be able to build at the end of the day) [5min.]
  - See example / Screenshot from LAB
  - ~~3 pages: home + work + about~~
  - main difference with module 1: backend code

- Node | Introduction [30min]

- Optional: ES6 modules vs. Common JS [30min]

- Refresh: "how the internet works" (request methods, status codes)
  - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-EgP1r7duakjZ6DXfReHIu9cYwEheAWEd_vDL7JtYiU/edit?usp=sharing

- (skip) Node | The Internet & HTTP Server

- Express | Introduction
  <!-- update: now includes Morgan + Middleware + express.json() -->
  

<!-- UPDATE: for demo, create "project-management-server" (instead of restaurant) and evolve it in the following days -->




## Active Learning

- (individual) LAB | Express Basic Server
- (in groups, 3:30pm) Mini Project
  - Read project brief + work on tasks for day 1.

<!-- workload is relatively light (most students finished mini-project early) -->
