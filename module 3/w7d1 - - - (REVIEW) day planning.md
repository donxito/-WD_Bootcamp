## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

Give feedback to students (ex. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

-->





## Planning

- Intro to module 3 (see .md file) [30min]

- (optional) Day Intro (explain what we will be able to build at the end of the day) [5min.]
  - See example / Screenshot from LAB
  - ~~3 pages: home + work + about~~
  - main difference with module 1: backend code

- Node | Introduction [30min]

- Optional: ES6 modules vs. Common JS [30min]

- Node | The Internet & HTTP Server

- Express | Introduction
  <!-- update: now includes Middleware -->




## Active Learning

- 2pm: LAB | Express Basic Server  (individual)
- 3:30pm Mini Project - REST API - Day 1 (in groups)

<!-- workload is relatively light (most students finished mini-project early) -->
