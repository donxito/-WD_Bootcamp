# w7d5


- Warmup:
  - Questions from yesterday's lab
  
  - Refresh
    - lifecycle & hooks
    - side-effect & useEffect
    - Routing

  - API request in App only
    - In the App from yesterday: show how it is possible to send only a single request to the API (if the API send an array with the details for all resources, we can avoid making a request for each resource).
    - Notes: 
      - takes a bit longer than it seems (30m + 15m)
      - when you access directly `/characters/1`, the app will fail, if we don't do conditional rendering (it is a good moment to see component lifecycle, adding some console.logs)




- Morning
  - initialize CRA: `npx create-react-app react-ironbnb-client`




- Afternoon:: 
  - show 2 examples of m3 projects.
    - first project with focus on MVP requirements (auth, 3 models, CRUD) + second project with other functionality
    - https://meet-them-all.netlify.app/
    - https://meetive.netlify.app

  - they can start thinking who they want to do it with + what they want to build
  - slack #project-ideas

- Should I start project3 this weekend ?
  - advice: start thinking & planning
  - wait for coding

@LT:

Monday NEXT WEEK (week8):
- we build a REST API
- most of those concepts are something they already know (we did it in m2)
- new concepts:
  - REST
  - res.json()
  - how to test the API with Postman
  - CORS

- One possible approach could be asking students to follow this unit as self-guided (note: they also have a lab & assessment)
- If so, provide a video explaining the new concepts & how to test the API with Postman
