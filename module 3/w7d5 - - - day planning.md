<!--

@Luis: tell TAs that we will probably not do lab kickoff (we can pass our notes to students)

Friday: try to finish earlier.

-->



- Warmup:
  - Questions from yesterday's lab
  
  - Refresh
    - lifecycle & hooks
    - side-effect & useEffect
    - Routing

  - (Extra) 2 API requests vs. 1 API request in App + pass info as props.
    - In the App from yesterday: show how it is possible to send only a single request to the API (if the API send an array with the details for all resources, we can avoid making a request for each resource).
    - Notes: 
      - takes a bit longer than it seems (30m + 15m)
      - when you access directly `/characters/1`, the app will fail, if we don't do conditional rendering (it is a good moment to see component lifecycle, adding some console.logs)




- Morning
  - Work on IronBnb (I have created a minilab for this)



- Afternoon:: 
  - show 2 examples of m3 projects.
    - first project with focus on MVP requirements (auth, 3 models, CRUD) + second project with other functionality
    - https://meet-them-all.netlify.app/
    - https://meetive.netlify.app

  - they choose the pairs (ie. we will not do the pairs)
  - they can start thinking who they want to do it with + what they want to build
  - create slack channel #project-ideas


- Should I start project3 this weekend ?
  - advice: start thinking & planning
  - wait for coding


<!--
@Luis:
- if we ask any student to do project individual, tell them asap

<!-- 

@LT:

Monday NEXT WEEK (week8):
- we build a REST API
- most of those concepts are something they already know (we did it in m2)
- new concepts:
  - REST
  - res.json()
  - how to test the API with Postman
  - CORS

- One possible approach could be asking students to follow this unit as self-guided (note: they also have a lab & assessment)
- If so, provide a video explaining the new concepts & how to test the API with Postman
