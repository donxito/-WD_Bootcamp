  - show 2 examples of m3 projects.
    - first project with MVP requirements (auth, 3 models, CRUD)
      https://meet-them-all.netlify.app/
    - second project more advanced.

  - they can start thinking what they want to build
  

- Should I start project3 this weekend ?
  - advice: start thinking & planning
  - wait for coding

@LT:

Monday week8:
- we build a REST API
- most of those concepts are something they already know (we did it in m2)
- new concepts:
  - REST
  - res.json()
  - how to test the API with Postman
  - CORS
- One possible approach could be asking students to follow this unit as self-guided
- If so, provide a video explaining the new concepts & how to test the API with Postman
