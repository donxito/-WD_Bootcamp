# Node - The Internet and HTTP Server


<!-- 

SKIP this unit (go directly to Express)

-->


<!-- 

- Part 1: Skip all (we have already covered all this content) untill 'Why would I use a backend?'

- Part 2: 
  - option 1: demo (do not do codealong)
  - option 2: SKIP alltogether (we'll just need the concept of PORT, which we can explain with Express)

-->



## Demo (follow students portal, starting from 'Node HTTP Server')

Time: [30min.]



Intro:
- Goal:
  - We will build a basic server, listening for http requests
  - (we build the Server in the Request-Response model)
- Syntax is not relevant (we will be using Express)
