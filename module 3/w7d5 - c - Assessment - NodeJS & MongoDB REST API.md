Title: Assessment - NodeJS & MongoDB REST API (202403)

Time: max. 2h

Task:
- Create a REST API (Express + Mongoose)
- 2 models (album, purchase)
- populate



## Errors

- Error: "TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'schema')"
    - Reason: students will get this error if they run the tests before creating both models
    - Solution: they need to implement both models first + export them.
