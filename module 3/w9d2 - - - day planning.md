## Day Planning:

- 9am: Deployment (follow the recordings in #class-activities)
  - Work in pairs: follow the recordings together from one computer (it is important that both of you understand all those concepts)
  - If you have errors while following the video, try to understand what is happening (if you can not solve it, ask for support).
  - You can also send a request if you want to clarify any point.

- 12:00: standup

- Submit URLs in the students portal. Deadline: 5pm


- Note: it's Tuesday, it's normal if the your project isn't finished yet (but make sure to submit URLs + make sure you submit the correct URL).
