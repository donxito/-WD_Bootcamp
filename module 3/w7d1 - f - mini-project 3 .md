# Mini-Project 3


What:
- Build a REST API "cohort tools" (Express.js + Mongoose)
- Integrate it with an existing React App


Groups:
- Work in groups of 4
- (depending on cohort size, some groups of 3 may be needed)
<!-- 
    IMPORTANT: 
    - if there's a group of 3, share with them the planning to rotate roles.
    - see "TEACHER | Week 7 README"
-->


How:
- "Research team" vs. "dev team"
- 2 students each
- Roles will rotate daily (ie. research team would be dev team the next day)
