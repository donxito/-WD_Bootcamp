# React - Connecting React app to the backend

<!--

Status: draft

Notes:
- In this unit we put together all concepts from previous week
  - Only new concepts: 
    - POST to create a resource on API (we send the request onSubmit + we send the details in the body of the axios request)
- Methodology: build together with students

 -->



Setup:

`npx create-react-app react-ironbnb-client`

`npm i react-router-dom axios`



Explain API & test endpoints

- IronBnB API:
  https://ironbnb-m3.herokuapp.com

  (note: PUT and DELETE are probably not supported, tested on Postman)


- Refresh REST APIs


Plan App/UX:


- Option 1: give them the wireframes & start building

- Option 2: plan together
  https://whimsical.com/



Start building:

- Ask students who feels confident to start coding 
  - Start making small groups so that they can code in breakout rooms
  - LT in main room with students that feel less confident
  - TAs with students that don't feel confident but can do
