# React - Connecting React app to the backend


## Refresh

Refresh REST APIs




## Intro to today

Notes:
- In this unit we put together all concepts from previous week
- New concepts: 
  - POST to create a resource on API
    - We send the request onSubmit
    - We send the details in the body of the request
    - Once we get the response from the API, we can redirect.




## LAB/Exercise IronBnB

Instructions: https://github.com/luisjunco/exercise-react-ironbnb-client

How:
- individual

Time:
- Some students get all the functionlity in about 2h (even with bonus things in 2-4h).
- Some students need a lot of help (ex. 2-3h to get routing + display the list of apartments or start the functionality to create)


<!-- 

@Luis/TAs:
- provide help to students that struggle more, so that then can get the list of apartments quickly & they start the functionality to CREATE.


Alternative:
- Ask students who feels confident to start coding 
  - Start making small groups so that they can code in breakout rooms
  - LT in main room with students that feel less confident
  - TAs with students that don't feel confident but can do
  
-->



Notes:
- this exercise covers all concepts from students portal + what they need for the lab "React Ironbeers"
- the api doesn't support PUT and DELETE (tested on Postman)
