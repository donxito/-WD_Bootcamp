<!-- 

Status: just some notes

@todo:
- improve notes, describing each step (esp. for state)
- create slides or cheatsheet


w7d2 is quite challenging for students. Start at good pace from beginning.

Mark bonus labs as "extra" in the students portal


LAB "React IronContacts" is very challenging
- offer students the possibility to work in pairs
- give extra guidance for iteration 1
