- Project 3: 
  - Show 2 examples of m3 projects.
    - first project with MVP requirements (auth, 3 models, CRUD)
    - second project more advanced.
  - They can start thinking what they want to build
  - Ask students to write TAs their preferences (pairs, teams etc)


- (optional) Refresh React concepts:
  - can be done in pairs (45m+15m) or all together (30m.)

- Run Commands:
  
  - `mkdir project-management-fullstack` (IMPORTANT: create directory for both repos)
  - `cd project-management-fullstack`
  - `npx --yes ironlauncher@latest project-management-server --auth --json` (IMPORTANT: "--auth --json" )
  - `npx --yes create-react-app project-management-client`


    <!-- 
  
    @Luis / IMPORTANT
    @Luis / IMPORTANT
    @Luis / IMPORTANT
    @Luis / IMPORTANT
    
    initialize with ironlauncher --auth --json 
    (so that we can speed up backend auth lecture)

<!-- 

- React | Building the Rest API (time: 3.5h / and going a bit fast)
- React | Integrating the React App

  -> these 2 lessons, do them directly copying the content from students portal (make sure students understand all steps)
  -> (otherwise they take toooo much time)


  - Second lesson (" Integrating the React App")
    - will be better to ask students to do as self-guided (or provide a video)


-->



<!-- 

@todo: 
- create CSS and provide it to students (it will help them understand the UI and the project better) 

-->



End of the day:
- Context API: ask students to do it as self guided (contains a lot of code, students may enjoy more doing by themselves)
