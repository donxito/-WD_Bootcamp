# LAB - Wiki Countries

Main topics:
- Routing (Routes, URL parameters)
- useEffect
- API requests (fetch / axios)

Other topics:
- Bootstrap (focus on the logic and the concepts we have seen today)


Note:
- We use URL parameters (they don't need query string)


Notes to students:
- Leave style, bootstrap, flags etc for the end (focus on practicing the concepts we've seen today)
- If you want to access the name of the country you need name.common
- You need the alpha3code for the url for each country
- You need borders, it's an array (some countries don't have borders, so it is empty)
- Navbar component is not a Route, it's always there!
- To display all borders .map() over it (it's an array)


## Iteration 1.4

- Flags: you can skip it (focus on React)


## Iteration 4 | Bonus | Fetch one country data from an API

> "make a request to the RestCountries API and fetch the data for the specific country"

- We do that to practice useEffect and API requests.
- Another alternative would be to pass the details from the parent component through props (`<App>` list of countries with all details).
