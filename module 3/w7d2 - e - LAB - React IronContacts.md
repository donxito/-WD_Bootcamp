## Iteration 1:


- IMPORTANT: STUDENTS FIND CONFUSING THE EXPLANATION IN ITERATION 1


For the Files:
- You can put all the components in App.js or, if you prefer, you can also create one file per component (as we did in class)

For the Component Hierarchy:
- Choose this option:
  - <App> component (inside that component display all contacts in a <table>, without creating a specific component for the contact).

- Avoid:
  - <App> + <Contact>
  - <App> + <ContactList> + <Contact>
  - Both of them are a great approach (we will take this approach often, when we want something reusable) but, with the things we've learned, if you use this approach the iteration to remove a contact will be more difficult.



## Iteration 2:

- Emoji: you can put it directly in your code (will just work), üèÜ


## Iteration 5 | Remove Contacts

- Passing an argument in onClick: we need an anonymous function
