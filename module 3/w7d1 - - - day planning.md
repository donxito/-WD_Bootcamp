# w7d1 Planning

<!-- 

Status: complete

Notes:
- Section "feeling ready" took a bit of time. Can be good to leave it for end of day or maybe during project week (today we introduce important concepts).
- w7d2 is challenging. Try to make further progress today so that tomorrow is not so heavy.

## Prework React (weekend)

- Weekend Homework (before starting module 3), watch:
