<!-- 

Status: complete

Notes:
- w7d2 is challenging. Try to make further progress today so that tomorrow is not so heavy.

## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

- just as we did for project1, pls check students projects and, for each project, do the following 2 things (you may need Monday + Tuesday):

1. Give feedback to students (ex. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

2. Grade each project.
- I believe we don't have specific guidelines for that grade, so let's take into account both code + final result.
- That grade can be done from the same person that reviews each project
- Let's also aim for simplicity (we should not spend more than 2-5 minutes to decide each mark :pray:).


Note: for pair projects, we can apply the same grade, unless there's clear reasons to assign a different grade to a student in the same team.

## Intro to module 3

- Intro to module 3: [30m]

  - Slides (React + MERN + deployment diagram):
    - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pGyIT8lYwxq5ftCoye5KK6TbJfgJxO3t2MdoOxsl4ss/edit?usp=sharing

  - Content overview (7-day lectures + project)

  - LABs
    - individual / pairs (confirm)

  - Project 3:
    - individual / pairs (recommended)

    - if a student is falling behind in labs or requirements to graduate, we will ask them to do project 3 individual.
   - when this is the case, we contact them before we start project 3 (we still have quite a few labs).

    - for all other students. Recommendation: pairs
      - advantages:
        - collaboration
        - being able to go further than an MVP.

  <!-- @Luis: include the notes above in the slides (labs, project etc) -->


  - See project requirements
    - 3 models
    - 2 repos

  - See sample project:
    - https://meet-them-all.netlify.app

  - On that example, see how it works as an SPA.

  - WARNING: 
    - m3 is very challenging for most students 
    - p3 takes time.
