# w7d1 Planning


<!-- 

Status: complete

Notes:
- w7d2 is challenging. Try to make further progress today so that tomorrow is not so heavy.

-->




## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

Give feedback to students (ex. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

## Intro to module 3

- Intro to module 3: [30m]

  - Slides (React + MERN + deployment diagram):
    - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pGyIT8lYwxq5ftCoye5KK6TbJfgJxO3t2MdoOxsl4ss/edit?usp=sharing

  - Content overview (7-day lectures + project)

  - LABs
    - individual / pairs (confirm)

    <!-- 
    @Luis: share lab planning with students
     -->

  - Project 3: in pairs.

    <!--
    
    - if a student is falling behind in labs or requirements to graduate, we will ask them to do project 3 individual.
    
    - when this is the case, we contact them before we start project 3 (we still have quite a few labs).

    -->


    - Why we do p3 in pairs:
        - collaboration
        - being able to go further than an MVP.


  <!-- @Luis: include the notes above in the slides (labs, project etc) -->


  - See project requirements
    - 3 models
    - 2 repos

  - See sample project:
    - https://meet-them-all.netlify.app

  - On that example, see how it works as an SPA.
    - compare with project 2 (ex. https://somethings-cooking.adaptable.app/)

  - WARNING: 
    - m3 is very challenging for most students 
    - p3 takes time.

  <!-- 
  
  @Luis:

  Consider doing "React training [steps 1-7]" (instead of "React Tweets")

  Topics Covered in steps 1-7:
  - components, props
  - inline style / conditional css
  - props.children
  - conditional rendering
  
  Things to Consider:
  - would need to move Conditional Rendering to w7d1 (can be good to make d2 ligher)
  - currently we don't have solutions (solutions for 1-7 can be enough)

  -->
