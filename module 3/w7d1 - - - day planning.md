## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

Give feedback to students (e.g. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

-->
