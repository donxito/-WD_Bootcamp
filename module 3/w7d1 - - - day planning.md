# w7d1 Planning

<!-- 

Status: complete

Notes:
- Section "feeling ready" took a bit of time. Can be good to leave it for end of day or maybe during project week (today we introduce important concepts).
- w7d2 is challenging. Try to make further progress today so that tomorrow is not so heavy.

## Project feedback (ask TAs)


<!--

Project 2 feedback:

- just as we did for project1, pls check students projects and, for each project, do the following 2 things (you may need Monday + Tuesday):

1. Give feedback to students (ex. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)

2. Grade each project.
- I believe we don't have specific guidelines for that grade, so let's take into account both code + final result.
- That grade can be done from the same person that reviews each project
- Let's also aim for simplicity (we should not spend more than 2-5 minutes to decide each mark :pray:).


Note: for pair projects, we can apply the same grade, unless there's clear reasons to assign a different grade to a student in the same team.
