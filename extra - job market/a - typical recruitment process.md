# TYPICAL RECRUITMENT PROCESS


Every process is different. In my experience, this is how a typical interview process may look like:


- Screening interview 
  - quick (5-20m)
  - usually with a non-technical person (HR, recruiter...)
  - advice: positive attitude + all good! (your goal here is just  to make it to the next step)


- Interview
  - usually with sb technical


- Technical test
  - examples: 
    - technical interview (verbal)
    - live coding
    - technical test (1h-3h)
    - implement project (some days) 


- Review of technical test (sometimes)


- Team Interview (sometimes)
