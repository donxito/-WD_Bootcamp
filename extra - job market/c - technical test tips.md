# Technical Test Tips


Steps:
1. Understand (if anything is not clear, ask)
2. Plan
3. Code
  - Do not hesitate to research / use google.
  - Perfection paralysis: sometimes we get stuck because we're looking for a "good" or "elegant" solution. If that happens, just aim for the most basic code that solves the problem.


Be ready when the moment arrives:
- Keep coding
- Katas


Final tips:
- if you have questions ask
- Make sure you have full availability to do the test (if you don't, tell them in advance so that they don't send you the test)
- time management
- be careful with last minute submits
