# Interview Tips


DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH:
- quick research about the company (5min.)
- quick research about the people in the interview (what's their role) (5min.)
- read the job offer carefully (technologies etc)


PREPARE YOUR PITCH:
- what they're looking for
- what I can offer (what are my strong points)


TECHNICAL PREP.:
- refresh/learn about technologies they may require


GENERAL ADVICE:
- positive attitude
- confident (eg. before interview, do 20 push ups + write on a big paper "this role is mine")
- natural
- it's ok not to know things, it's ok to ask things
  - exception: in the screening interview, don't worry about details (but make sure it's something you'd be interested in).
- it's ok to fail


@students: 
- what works best for you?
