DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH:
- research 5min. about the company
- research 5min. about the people in the interview (what's their role)
- read the job offer carefully (technologies etc)

PREPARE YOUR PITCH:
- what they're looking for
- what I can offer (what are my strong points)


TECHNICAL PREP.:
- refresh/learn about technologies they may require


GENERAL ADVICE:
- screening interview --> positive attitude + all good! (goal: move on to next stage)
- positive attitude
- confident (eg. before interview, do 20 push ups + write on a big paper "this role is mine")
- natural
- it's ok not to know things, it's ok to ask things (exception: screening interview just the basics)
- it's ok to fail
