# Mock Interview



## Technical Interview - JavaScript

- Implement `String.prototype.indexOf()` without using native functions (can use `str.charAt()`).
- Bonus: TDD

Alternatives:
- Throwing Darts (not particularly difficult, can also be a good warmup): https://www.codewars.com/kata/525dfedb5b62f6954d000006
- The wheat/rice and chessboard problem (easy to solve if you think in binary): https://www.codewars.com/kata/5b0d67c1cb35dfa10b0022c7/


## Technical Interview - React

- Initial code: https://github.com/ironhack-rmt-materials/technical-interview-react
- Demo: https://technical-interview-react-demo.netlify.app/


Q:
- If no albums to display, display a message (`Sorry, no albums to display`)
- SearchBar
