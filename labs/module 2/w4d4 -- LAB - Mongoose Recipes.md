## REMIND

 - Fork
 - Clone

### Guidelines for LAB

- `npm install` this should install mongoose

- Create the model for Recipes

- Create your first Recipe

- Run `node index.js` to test your code
  - HINT: Test after each modification on the code

- Check if the db was updated using Mongo Compass

### COMMON MISTAKES

- Chaining the .then() as a callback hell

- Not checking if the updates were made on the db

- Remember to always remove the recipes before trying to add the new ones
