##### TIPS:
Run npm install in terminal, inside the directory of working file.
Then run this command : npm run test:watch
Then open lab-solution.html with live sever, to see test result
Don’t change function names! Because automatic tests cannot pass the test if you change function’s name!
No need to CALL functions
