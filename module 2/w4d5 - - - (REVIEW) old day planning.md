## Initial Setup

We will continue working on the app from yesterday:


a) If you have it ready:
  - Make sure it's running (ie. have the code open + see the result in the browser)
  - In case you need to launch it: "npm run dev -- --port 3002"


b) If you don't have the app from yesterday:
  
  <!-- @LT provide link to the repo -->

  - fork
  - clone
  - cd directoryName 
  - npm install
  - npm run dev -- --port 3002

c) If you already created a fork, you will not be able to create a second fork.

In that case, you can get the latest changes following these steps:
  - Synchronize from the original repo: https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-75616/images/help/repository/sync-fork-dropdown.png
  - Then, do "git pull"
  - If both versions have diverged, you git pull will give you an error.
  - In that case, you may want to do `git reset --hard origin/master` (waring, this will discard all your changes!)




We continue at xxxx.
