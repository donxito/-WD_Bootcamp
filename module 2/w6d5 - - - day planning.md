-->


- Afternoon: prepare readme, slides and presentation, or just enjoy
  - Readme file
  - Slides
  - Presentation
    - Plan (how we will do presentation)
    - Data on production DB
    - Images (if you have to upload, etc...)


- game (TBC. eg. 14:30h)





## After Presentations:

Planning to improve project 2 ?
- keep in mind that now it's a pair project
- agree with your partner
- some options:
  - a. coordinate or do pair programming
  - b. branch & PR
  - c. you can also fork + deploy a different version (you'd need to deploy DB + code).


Module 3:
  - module 3 is very demanding
  - (skip) project 3 takes a lot of time. They need to focus 100% on MVP.



Task: Getting Familiar with React
- see below (46min.)





## Task: Getting Familiar with React


<!--

@Luis

feb 2023: i've added a unit on w7d1.

-->


Task: 
  - Watch the first 46min. of this video: https://youtu.be/jLS0TkAHvRg

Goal: 
  - Start getting familiar with some React concepts (learning React is challenging).

Notes:
  - You don't need to go further that minute 46 (but, if you want, you can watch those 46 minutes 2 times).
  - You don't need to install Node (we already have it installed).
  - You don't need to understand everything (we will be covering all those concepts from the beginning).


The following concepts are specially relevant:
  - Components (what is a component, how we can create a component)
  - Props (what are props, how we pass & use props)
  - State (what is state, how we can use it)
