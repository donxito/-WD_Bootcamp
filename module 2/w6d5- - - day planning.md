Homework for this weekend:
- pls fill in our weekly survey (3 minutes)
- do the task below
- take some rest & enjoy the weekend ;) 



Task:

- Goal: start getting familiar with some React concepts (learning React is challenging).

- You don't need to understand everything (we will be covering all those concepts from the beginning). 

- Please watch the first 46min. of this video: https://youtu.be/jLS0TkAHvRg
  - You don't need to go further that minute 46 (but, if you want, you can watch those 46 minutes 2 times).
  - You don't need to install Node (we already have it installed).
  - The following concepts are specially relevant:
    - Components (what is a component, how we can create a component)
    - Props (what are props, how we pass & use props)
    - State (what is state, how we can use it)
