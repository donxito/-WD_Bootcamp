## Part 2: codealong


Methodology:
- create "IronRestaurant"
- we will evolve it during the following days of week 4 (week5 we start using generator)
- sample repo: https://github.com/RemoteRaccoons-Ironhack-Nov-22/ironrestaurant-pizzaForEach/

    

- Goal today for "IronRestaurant":
    - home
    - contact
    - one image + css
    - nav menu

- ask students: how do we want to call our pizza company

- notes: 
  - some students have problems installing `nodemon`. Just use `sudo`.
  - for images & css, use an absolute path (we will save time tomorrow)

  <!--
  
    @Luis: 
    - add a NAVIGATION MENU (will be useful to have it for tomorrow)
    - takes longer that expected (students find difficulties with static files, paths etc)

## Extra: Node.js Modules

- https://stackabuse.com/how-to-use-module-exports-in-node-js 

- Can do an exercise to practice with that.
