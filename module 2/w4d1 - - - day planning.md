## Planning


- Refresh on Asynchronous code & callbacks
  - Final result: https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-m92ra4?file=index.js


- Introduce .fetch() and make a quick demo getting list of users from jsonplaceholder api (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
  - Extra concepts:
    - API & REST API
    - JSON
  - See how fetch returns a Promise
  

- Introduce the concept of Promises & explain why they were added to JS
  - Definition of promise from MDN
  - "Callback hell"

- CONSUMING PROMISES with .then().catch()
  - .then().catch()
  - chaining promises 
    - (eg. get list of users and after that list of posts)
  - Promise.all()
    - (eg. get list of users, albums & todos)


- CONSUMING PROMISES with async/await
  - ES8
  - syntax (with function declaration & function expression)
  - error handlying with try-catch


- LAB
  - show how the function obtainInstruction() returns a Promise


- (after lab) CREATING PROMISES
