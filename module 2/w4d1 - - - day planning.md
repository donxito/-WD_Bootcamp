-->




## Project feedback (ask TAs)

<!--

Project 1 feedback:

Give feedback to students (ex. if you see anything to they can learn from).
- Let's keep it positive.
- Let's keep it brief (they'll be busy)
- Let's keep it focused on things they can learn from (they will probably not have time to implement any suggestions)


-->
