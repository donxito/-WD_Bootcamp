  <!-- 
  
  @Luis:

  Consider doing "React training [steps 1-7]" (instead of "React Tweets")

  Topics Covered in steps 1-7:
  - components, props
  - inline style / conditional css
  - props.children
  - conditional rendering
  
  Things to Consider:
  - would need to move Conditional Rendering to w7d1 (can be good to make d2 ligher)
  - currently we don't have solutions (solutions for 1-7 can be enough)

## Extra challenges

- LAB JS ES6 Reinforcement (for...of loop, .filter()):
  https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-js-es6-reinforcement

- Practice Promises & .fetch()
  - Create a basic html document with one button
  - When the user clicks on the button, fetch the list of users from here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
  - From the list of users, get only the users that live in a specific city (hint: arr.filter())
  - Display the information of those users in the console (easier) or directly on the page (dom manipulation)
