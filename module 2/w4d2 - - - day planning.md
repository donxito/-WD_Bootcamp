<!--

Notes:

- Morning includes a lot of theory and concepts (how the internet works, intro to node etc)

- Try to make it "FUN, SHORT AND DYNAMIC"

- Finish early to start lab early

- IF WE HAVE TIME:
  - Explain how to collaborate on the same repo on git
    - Student 1:
      - forks lab
      - adds the other student as collaborator
      - pair programming
      - commit + push
    - Student 2:
      - clones the same repo (we will not fork it)
      - pull
      - pair programming
      - commit + push
  - Intro git conflicts

-->



- Destructuring + spread operator:
  - quick refresh object destructuring
    - exercise (2min): https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-exphb3?file=index.js
  - array destructuring:
    - example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/js-hfvsxk?file=index.js
    - note: order matters
  - SPREAD OPERATOR (see `w4d4 - d - JS - Destructuring Assignment and Parameter Handling.md`)




- Intro: explain them what we will be able to build at the end of the day
  - Example (from Felipe): https://hugh-laurie.adaptable.app/




## Extra challenges

- LAB JS ES6 Reinforcement (for...of loop, .filter()):
  https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lab-js-es6-reinforcement

- Practice Promises & .fetch()
  - Create a basic html document with one button
  - When the user clicks on the button, fetch the list of users from here: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
  - From the list of users, get only the users that live in a specific city (hint: arr.filter())
  - Display the information of those users in the console (easier) or directly on the page (dom manipulation)
