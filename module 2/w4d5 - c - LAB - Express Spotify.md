# LAB - Express Spotify



## Iteration 1 | Spotify API Setup
- We need creadentials to interact with Spotify API
  - they will need a Spotify account (or create one if they don't have)


- Create a .env file and store your credentials

    ```
    CLIENT_ID=your clientId goes here
    CLIENT_SECRET=your clientSecret goes here
    ```

    - Notes:
        - why we use a .env file (store credentials, config. that depends on environment...)
        - .env is added to .gitignore

- Run app:
  - `npm run dev` or `nodemon app.js`





## Extra challenges

- (super bonus): implement pagination (can be a bit tricky, read documentation)
