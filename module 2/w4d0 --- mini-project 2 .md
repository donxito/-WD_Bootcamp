# Mini-Project 2


What:
- React app (choose from a given list of options)


Groups:
- Work in groups of 2
- (depending on cohort size, some groups of 3 may be needed)


How:
- Pair programming
- IMPORTANT: tell students to follow pair programming (work together on the same tasks). We still haven't seen how to integrate code changes.
