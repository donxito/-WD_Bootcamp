<!-- 




@todo: IMPROVE / SIMPLIFY 
- remove anything not essential
- first, introduce the concept (ex. with slides) & then see how to apply it (demo) ?
  - ex. 
    - passing a callback as props
    - lifting state up
    - forwarding props to grandchild
    - ...


@update:
- Main => MovieList
- Movie => MovieSummary



Notes:
- We will work on the app "popcorn-time" we created the day before

LABs today are VERY VERY demanding
- try to finish earlier so that they have more time

-->


## Refresh

- (skip) Routing cheatsheet
  - setup
  - basic routing
  - url params


Show the app we were building yesterday
- list of movies loaded from `json` (in most apps, it would come from an API)
- component hierarchy (see react dev tools + see code)





## Planning

Popcorn Time II...

Lifting state up [~~3h~~] [1.5h]
- (skip) Create a Movie component (will display the details of a movie)
  <!-- Nope, do not create Movie component  -->
- Display number of movies in the Header component (Lifting state up)
  - Fix Delete functionality (Passing callback to grandchild)


Forms: [2.5h]
- functionality to add movies (Step 1: form with 1 field)
- functionality to add movies (Step 2: form with multiple fields)
  - as an exercise (see "React - Forms.md")
- fix: routing (generate unique id's)
- (extra) functionality to add movies (Step 3: extract to a separate component)
- (extra) Handling multiple inputs with a single method


Extra:
- functionality for searchbox (asked in today's lab)

  Bonus: Iteration 4 | Refactor - Form Component
  - make sure you commit before you start refactoring.
  - (that way, if you need to roll back, you can just discard the changes with "git restore")
