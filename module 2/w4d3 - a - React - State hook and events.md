# React - State hook and events

<!--

Status: draft

@todo: 
- improve the planning for this unit (examples & steps to follow)
- create slides (ex. syntax, functional updates etc.)

-->


## Intro

- 2 Types of components
  - Function components
  - Class components


- Hooks:
  > Hooks let you use different React features from your components. 
  


- We've learned how to pass info with props
  - props = info that comes from outside of the component

- State:
  - Allows components to store internal data ("information")
  - We can use that information in JSX, when we describe the User Interface

> "State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component."


- Things to keep in mind:
  - ~~state is an object~~
  - state can change overtime
  - state "lives" in the component and belongs to the component itself (props come from outside)
  - changes in state can affect component rendering and what the component displays


- Function vs Class components
  - State available in class components
  - In function components with "hooks"



## State in function components


Option 1: 
- work on the app we built yesterday

Option 2 (prefered, since its easier to share the code): 
- work here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-s2s6wx?file=src%2FApp.js

DEMO: add a counter to the Header

  <!-- @Luis:  DEMO (we will do an exercise in a few moments)  -->

  - display a message: "Number of likes: XXXX"
  - add button 
  - add onClick event
  - Explain these two patterns (before implementing the function):
    - `onClick={() => { console.log("clicked...")}}`
    - `onClick={increaseCounter}`
  - Explain how to send an argument:
    - `onClick={ () => {increaseCounter(20)}}`
  - Try to solve with a normal variable & see how that doesn't work.

      ```js
          let counter = 0;

          const increaseCounter = () => {
              console.log("increasing counter....")
              counter++;
              console.log(counter)
          }
      ```

  - Intro State: 
    - Store information that belongs to a component
    - Can change over time
    - We want to reflect the changes in the UI (JSX)

  - useState hook:
    - https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#reference

  -  Syntax:
    - `const [something, setSomething] = useState(initialValue);`


  - Solve with State

    ```js
      const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
    ```

    ```js
    counter++; // never
    setCounter( counter + 1 );
    setCounter( counter++ ); // avoid (will modify state directly)

    ```


Explain:
- in a component we can have multiple stateful variables
  ```js
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
    const [pizza, setPizza] = useState("margaritta");
  ```



## Practice: React State

<!-- @Luis: remember to FORK  -->

Initial code:
https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-723xsm?file=src%2FApp.js

Note: work on the App component (do not create other components)


Iteration 1:
- implement functionality to increase counter

Iteration 2:
- add a second button to decrease counter

Iteration 3:
- counter should never be below 0

Bonus 1: 
- if counter above 10, change bg color of the component
- Hint: you can use css classes (className)

Bonus 2:
- Solve the previous bonus with inline style (research React inline style)

Bonus 3:
- You may have solved the previous challenges using two functions (ex. "increaseCounter" and "dicreaseCounter")
- Can we solve it with only one function ?

```jsx

const updateCounter = (diff) => {
  //.....
}


<button onClick={ () => updateCounter(+1)}>Like üëç</button>
<button onClick={ () => updateCounter(-1)}>Dislike üëé</button>

```


Time: 20min.

Solution 1 (with 2 functions):
- https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-2abw6z?file=src%2FApp.js


Solution 2 (with only one function):
- https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-xgf1gt?file=src%2FApp.js

Solution 3 (with `counter` + `theme`): 
- https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-hjbhv8?file=src/App.js





- (extra) add a counter to a component that repeats multiple times (ex. User/Movie)
  - see how the counter of each component is independent (state belongs to the component)

<!-- @todo: create example on stackblitz & share with students -->


## (extra) Practice: React State 2 (add buttons to change theme)


<!--
@Luis:

- Skip ??

- Instead of this exercise, we can implement Theme as "bonus 1" iteration in the previous exercise & give more time.

-->

Initial code:
- Work on the app we've been building.
- or, use this link: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-zp3sjk?file=src/App.js


In App.js, add 2 buttons:
  - "switch to light theme"
  - "switch to dark theme"

Implement functionality for those 2 buttons.
- ex. if user clicks "switch to dark theme", display a dark background
- ex. if user clicks "switch to light theme", display a light background

Hints:
- we can have `<div className="light">` and `<div className="dark">`
- it is information that changes over time + we want to reflect it in our JSX (we will need state)
- in a component we can have multiple stateful variables
- where we should store it (easiest option atm is in `App.js`)


Bonus:
- implement with a single button (ex. toggleTheme) and a single function.
- if theme changes, update the button (ex. display a different emoji). You may need to do some research.

Time: 20min.


Solution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ykh1uk?file=src/App.js





## Explain: Functional update

Why should I use a function if the new state depends on the previous? Example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/57828519/11298742





## Using State correctly

<!-- @todo: create slides -->


- Remember (https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#using-state-correctly):
  - Do Not Modify State Directly
    - note: `counter++` modifies state directly
  - State Updates May Be Asynchronous
  - State Updates are Merged (class components)
    - ("When you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.")

- A Component will Re-render if:
  - receives new props from the outside
  - its own state changes

- Useful:
  - See how component re-renders when we update state
  - See state in React Dev Tools





## When should we use the state

- State: 
  - Store information that belongs to a component
  - Can change over time
  - We want to reflect the changes in the UI (JSX)



## State vs. Props (IMPORTANT)

- See students portal




## (skip) Events (students portal)

<!-- not much to mention (we've already used onClick) -->
