<!--

Methodology:
- continue working on IronRestaurant
- we will create a separate file to practice mongoose methods.

- the part of data models can also be explained based on this project, eg:
  - Product model & Reviews as nested document
  - Product model & Seller model

-->


Consider these changes:

- "LAB | MongoDB - Advanced Querying"
  - can be self guided / extra
  - request students to do the only first 5 queries. 

- MongoDB | Data Models
  - move to next day (it also includes mongoose syntax)
