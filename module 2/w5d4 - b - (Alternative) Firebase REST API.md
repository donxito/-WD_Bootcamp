# Firebase REST API



## Discover: what's a REST API?

Task 1: watch this video 
  - What is a REST API? (explains RESTful) (6 min., Mosh): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLwpqD8n3d0

Task 2:
  - Define the endpoints for a REST API the allows to CRUD "recipes"
  - Example:
    - GET /recipes -- get a list of recipes
    - ...
    - ...

Time: 12min.

## Intro to this unit

- project 2 requirements: 
  - CRUD on an API

- Options:
  - Option 1: research & use an existing external API
    - example: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
  - Option 2: create your own API with Firebase

- Topics we will see in this unit:
  - How to get a REST API from Firebase
  - How to test it

- Firebase intro
  - Service from Google Cloud
  - Cloud-Based Backend: Firebase provides a comprehensive backend solution with tools like real-time databases, cloud storage and authentication. Allows developers to build applications without managing their own servers.
  - Exposes a REST API





## Creating an account at Firebase

Note: setup is very straight forward & at the moment it doesn't require payment details.


## Configure your project

- Click "Create a project"
- Choose a name for your project
- Google Analytics: can disable it (we will not use it)
- (takes 1-2 minutes)

- Build > "Realtime Database"
  - IMPORTANT: we will use "Realtime Database", not "Firestore Database"
  <!-- IMPORTANT -->
- Click: Create Database
- Select location (e.g. Europe)
- Select "Security rules"
  - Choose start in "locked mode"

- Update the rules to give public access to all users:
    ```json
    {
      "rules": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
    ```
  - Click "Publish"

  <!-- @LT: explain what that means (we're granting public access to all resources) -->


- Firebase will automatically expose a REST API.
  - The api url looks like "baseURL/resource.json"
  - Example endpoints:
    - "GET /recipes.json"
    - "GET /recipes/:recipeId.json"
    - "POST /recipes.json"
    - "PATCH /recipes/:recipeId.json" (thereâ€™s also PUT)
    - "DELETE /recipes/:recipeId.json"


- Quick demo with axios (e.g. on stackblitz)



## Intro to Postman


- (brief) Some options to send http requests:
  - Tools:
    - Postman
    - cURL
    - ...
  - JavaScript code:
    - http request (https://stackoverflow.com/a/4033310/11298742)
    - fetch()
    - libraries (ex. axios)



Install Postman
  - https://www.postman.com/downloads/
  - Don't need to create an account (link at the bottom: "Skip")


How to send a request:
- Example: GET https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random





## Test REST API endpoints


- Create: `POST /projects.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "title": "Configure a REST API using Firebase",
    "description": "Create an API that we'll consume from  our React App"
  }
  ```

  <!-- @LT: share URL and ask students to create a project  -->


- Read (all): `GET /projects.json`
  - IMPORTANT: notice that it returns an object, not an array (!)
  <!-- @LT: Explain / demo: in our React app, we want to convert this to an array -->
  - Note: if there's no resources, firebase will return null

- Read (single record by id): `GET /projects.json/:id`
  - Note: if we make an invalid request (e.g. `/projects/abc.json`), firebase will return null

- Partial Update: `PATCH /projects.json/:id`

- Delete: `DELETE /projects.json/:id`




Test second resource: "tasks"
- `POST /tasks.json`
- `GET /tasks.json`



Explain that we don't have validation (you can put any data)



<!--
test: Relationships
- Example: `projectId`

test: Embedding Related Records
- Example: GET http://localhost:5005/projects/1?_embed=tasks
-->



## (extra) Connect our React app

- Connect our React app to the API in production
  (for now, don't use env variables, just connect directly to production)


- Converting the object we get from Firebase to an array:

  ```jsx
  const projectsObject = response.data;

  const projectsArr = Object.keys(projectsObject).map((id) => ({
      id,
      ...projectsObject[id],
  }));

  setProjects(projectsArr);
  ```


## Pain points

Firebase doesn't follow some conventions that you see in most REST APIs:

- List of items: Firebase returns an object (instead of an array)
  - example: a GET request to `/projects.json` will return an object instead of an array (so you wanna convert it to an array in your react app).
- Wrong request: if you send a request to the wrong URL, on the browser you may get a CORS error (instead of a 404).
  - example: if you send a request to `/projects.json/42` instead of `/projects/42.json`
- If a list of items is empty: Firebase will return null (instead of an empty array)
- If an item does not exist: Firebase will return null (instead of a 404 error)
- Resource created: Firebase returns a 200 (instead of a 201)


Warning on rules:
- Explain that if we provide public access, anyone can CRUD any resource.
- It is possible to create more restrictive rules (and we should). In m3 we will also learn better patterns.

## (skip) Firebase Auth

- Create a gist or leave it for students to do some research.

- note: uses Firestore + SDK instead of the rest api
