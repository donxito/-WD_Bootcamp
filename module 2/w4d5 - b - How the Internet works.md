Status: ready but needs improvement.

- too much theory & concepts
  - Try to make it short, fun & dynamic.
  - add images & examples
  - add quiz

Concepts:

- Include "software ports" (note, this can also be introduced in w4d3, when we run our second app)
- Try to make more clear main concepts (verbs, status codes)
