# LAB - React Cohort Tools


- Iteration 1 | Setup React Router

- Iteration 2 | Create Routes
  - including route with url params: `/students/:studentId `

- Iteration 3 | Add Links
  - `<Link />`

- Iteration 4 | Show Student Details
  - a lot of code for `<StudentDetailsPage >` is given
  - (inc. loading a json file + a function to find student in an array)
  - they just need to fix that using `useParams`
