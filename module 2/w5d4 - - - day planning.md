<!--

On feb22 we did the following (went quite well):
- we started from an existing project with CRUD and Mongoose
- the initial code is in this repo: https://github.com/luisjunco/characters-crud
- Students & LT can fork this repo.
- The main goal of this codealong would be to move from DB to an API
  (we would use the API to read and store info)
- Explain students that this is just one excuse to practice axios.

- Final result (fork): https://github.com/Ironmaidens-Ironhack-Jan-2022/characters-crud
- See readme for main goals: https://github.com/Ironmaidens-Ironhack-Jan-2022/characters-crud/blob/main/README.md

## Extra challenges
- Implement same functionality using .fetch()
- Implement with async/await
