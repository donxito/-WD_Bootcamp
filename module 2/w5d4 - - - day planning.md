Slides: 
- https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G0RgvH93o_HT2mOZiotU9wkLNecdIDNGpIZJ1_ErZac/edit?usp=sharing



<!--
@todo:
- test with students + update slides
-->



<!-- 


Suggested path 1 (EASIER FOR STUDENTS ? -- test with them):

- git pull
  - "You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them"

- git config --global pull.ff true
  - Pull is fast-forwarded if possible, otherwise it's merged.





Suggested path 2:

- git pull
  - "You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them"

- git config --global pull.ff only
  - Pull is fast-forwarded if possible, otherwise operation is aborted with an error message.

- git pull
  - "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting"

- git merge origin/main
