<!-- 

m2-m3 swap:
- Codealong: follow students portal
- (don't do self-guided, with the new schedule, this is the time where we build a React app with full CRUD)

-->



## Planning

<!-- @LT: ask p2 preferences  -->

- LAB review
  
- Refresh
  - lifecycle & hooks
  - side-effect & useEffect
  - common pain points when sending requests to an API
    - ex. `useState()` + `undefined.map()`

- React | Integrating React App with backend [4h]


<!-- IMPORTANT: if we ask any student to do project individual, tell them asap -->


## Active Learning

Tomorrow: mini-projects presentation 
- 1 presentation for each category (todo list, e-commerce etc)
