<!--

Methodology:
- Continue adding functionality on our library app
- Example: https://github.com/ironhack-loopey-tunes-may2023/loopey-library-project



Notes: 
- day can be quite demanding
- we introduce new concepts but try to do exercises and solve challenges (ie, breakout rooms) as much as possible 



-->



## Planning

MORNING:
- FAQ about self-guided U+D (skip questions from lab)
  <!-- tell students that day will be demanding -->
- Explain relationships with examples [2h]
  <!-- short breaks often -->
- Codealong I [1.5h]
  - create Author model
  - seeds file with relationships
  - populate

BEFORE LUNCH: 
- ask for preferences project 2

AFTERNOON:
- Codealong II
  - Fix "CREATE Book"
  - Practice: READ Author
  - Fix "UPDATE Book"







IMPORTANT: ask students for preferences for project2


  ```js
  const myPreferences = {
      iWantToWorkwith: ["alice", "bob", "charly", "david", "elisabeth", "frank", "george"], // at least 7 names, ordered by preference
      iPreferToAvoid: ["", ""] // max 3 names
  }


  /*

  - NOTE: in your preferences, do not include ppl that you feel have a very different level than you.

  - HOW: msg TA on Slack
  - DEADLINE: Wednesday 14:00

  */

  ```

@students:
- we will try to take those preferences into consideration.
- in general, we try to avoid pairs with very different levels


<!--

- (optional) create channel #project-ideas on Slack.

- Try (automatic groups): 
  - https://clevergroups.com/tryit.php
  - https://github.com/A-Fitz/Group-Generator

- Or implement ourselves:

clevergroups.com:

Allows students to enter data themselves but it's not a great option.


If we ask students to fill in they preferences by themselves...

- "Teacher" just create the group and share link
Students needs to create account with their names and join the group
- Only when all of them are in, they’d be able to choose between all students, and only who they wanna work with. - This means we should wait for all of them to join the group, and then ask again to fill the preferences.
- They are not allow to fill who they don’t wanna work with, so they should still text us anyway (Only teacher can do that manually)

june23:
- we use a form (google forms)
  - example: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ji6OTC6T_N3nmr28kbELvnSAfuKjklq95yFhuzzh8SU/edit
- we export responses to spreadsheet
- and we upload the data to cleavergroups
