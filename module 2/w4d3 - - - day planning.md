<!--
- morning (dynamic views, partials etc) 
  - set them more challenges / exercises to do
  - note: these lessons can take time (esp. if we do more exercises)


Codealong:

Consider these changes in the planning:

- "LAB | MongoDB - Advanced Querying"
  - not so relevant, can be self guided / request students to do the only first 5 queries. 

- MongoDB | Data Models
  - move to next day (it also includes mongoose syntax)

- MongoDB | Indexing & Aggregation Framework
  - self-guided
