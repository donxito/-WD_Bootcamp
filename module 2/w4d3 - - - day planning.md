## Refresh

- props vs. State:

    - When should we use the PROPS:
    - Pass information to a child component
    - ex. reusable component that has different behaviour depending on info that it receives.

    - When should we use the STATE:
    - Store information that belongs to a component
    - Can change over time
    - We want to reflect the changes in the UI (JSX)

    - A Component will Re-render if:
    - receives new props from the outside
    - its own state changes

- Refresh syntax useState()

- Remember:
  - NEVER MODIFY STATE DIRECTLY 
  - State Updates May Be Asynchronous

- .map()

- Conditional rendering
