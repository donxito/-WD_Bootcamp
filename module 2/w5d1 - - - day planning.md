<!--

Methodology:
- Codealong for a library app
- This project can be expanded in the following days.
- Example: https://github.com/Ironmaidens-Ironhack-Jan-2022/mongoose-express-CRUD-codealong/commits/main


IMPORTANT:
- takes a lot of time.
- create a cheatsheet explaining steps for CRUD

- C+R: codealong
- U+D: SELF GUIDED.


-->


- (extra) Beginning of week: 
  - show examples of m2 projects.
  - they can start thinking what they want to build



## Refresh
- Refresh previous day(s).


## Codealong:

- IMPORTANT: 
  - Follow the same example ("library") & the same model as students portal  
    - So that we can use seed file later.
    - We will use this code for all lessons today (and can be expanded tomorrow)




## LABS:
- LAB | Express Cinema (seed + Read)
- LAB | Express Drones (seed + CRUD)

- To avoid repeating work, we can do only one LAB (ex. ask students to implement CRUD on Express Cinema + leave the other lab as optional)

- IMPORTANT: 
  - Express Cinema does not include C+U+D in the instructions
  - Update: they can implement functionality to update title & director
    - updating Stars is a bit more tricky but they can do it (eg. the user can enter all stars separated by a comma)



## Extra challenges:
- implement CRUD
- make Book model more complex (eg. enum, validation, default)
- CSS / Bootstrap
