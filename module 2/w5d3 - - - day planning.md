<!--

Notes: 
- day is very demanding (start fast-paced from the beginning).


Methodology:
- Continue adding functionality on our library app
- Example: https://github.com/Ironmaidens-Ironhack-Jan-2022/mongoose-express-CRUD-codealong/commits/main

-->




Summary:
- Some notes on security (storing passwords, cryptography)
- Registration: Creating user accounts
- Form validation
- Login & Sessions
- Logout
- Middleware (Custom middleware for user authorization)
- Passport
- ironlauncher --auth




ALTERNATIVE (instead of codealong, which can take the whole day):
- prepare a repo  <!-- @todo -->
- app created with Ironlauncher with functionality for auth but bugs
- provide a readme with steps to follow
- students would need to:
  - fix bugs (eg. why the code to render a form is not working)
  - implement extra functionality (eg create user, following instructions)
  - research & understand code (eg. why validation works etc)
- then, explain concepts (eg. login, sessions etc...)




IMPORTANT: ask students for preferences for project2


  ```js
  const myPreferences = {
      iWantToWorkwith: ["alice", "bob", "charly", "david", "elisabeth", "frank"], // 6 names, ordered by preference
      iPreferToAvoid: ["", ""] // max 3 names
  }

  // - HOW: msg TA on slack
  // - DEADLINE: thursday 9am
  ```

@students:
- we will try to take those preferences into consideration.
- in general, we try to avoid pairs with very different levels


<!--

- (optional) create channel #project-ideas on Slack.

- Try (automatic groups):
