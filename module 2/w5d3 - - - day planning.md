<!--

m2-m3 swap:
- Codealong: follow students portal
- (don't do self-guided, with the new schedule, this is the time where we build a React app with full CRUD)

-->



## Planning


- LAB Q&A [20m]

  
- Refresh
  <!-- @LT: skip refresh (we'll see all those concepts during the day) -->
  - lifecycle & hooks
  - side-effect & useEffect
  - common pain points when sending requests to an API
    - ex. `useState()` + `undefined.map()`



- React | Integrating React App with backend [4h]




## Active Learning

- (individual) React Iron Brewers

<!-- 

feb 2025:
- AI feedback is giving inaccurate results on this lab (likely because it's a fork from another lab).
- more info: https://team-ironhack.slack.com/archives/CHB9RLPEF/p1739378353595149

- Note: while it's fixed, tell students to open the PR using the option "Contribute" > "Open Pull Request"

-->


- (in pairs) Mini Project
  - Deadline to submit mini-projects: Friday 9am.
  - Note: don't worry about preparing a presentation

Bonus: work further on the mini-project and implement additional functionality.
