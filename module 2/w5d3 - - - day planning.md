<!--

Notes: 
- day is very demanding (start fast-paced from the beginning).


Methodology:
- Continue adding functionality on our library app
- Example: https://github.com/Ironmaidens-Ironhack-Jan-2022/mongoose-express-CRUD-codealong/commits/main





@LT:
- finish by 3pm-4pm
- Assessment DEADLINE today.


Assessment "NodeJS and MongoDB CRUD app (202306)" 
(aka. "[WEB] M2 - CRUD App with populate [V6]")

  - does  not work on current version Qualified:
    const {mongoose, Schema, model } = require("mongoose");

  - can do the following:
     const mongoose = require("mongoose");
     const { Schema, model } = require("mongoose");

  - or just use Schema

UPDATE (aug. 2023): fixed in V6.

Planning:
- Notes on security (storing passwords, cryptography) [1h]
- bcrypt demo
- Registration: Creating user accounts
- Form validation
- Login & Sessions
- Logout

Tomorrow:
- Middleware (Custom middleware for user authorization)
- ironlauncher --auth




ALTERNATIVE (instead of codealong, which can take the whole day):
- prepare a repo  <!-- @todo -->
- app created with Ironlauncher with functionality for auth but bugs
- provide a readme with steps to follow
- students would need to:
  - fix bugs (eg. why the code to render a form is not working)
  - implement extra functionality (eg create user, following instructions)
  - research & understand code (eg. why validation works etc)
- then, explain concepts (eg. login, sessions etc...)
