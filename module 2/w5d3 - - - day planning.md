<!--

Notes: 
- day is very demanding (start fast-paced from the beginning).


Methodology:
- Continue adding functionality on our library app
- Example: https://github.com/Ironmaidens-Ironhack-Jan-2022/mongoose-express-CRUD-codealong/commits/main

-->


Summary:
- Some notes on security (storing passwords, cryptography)
- Registration: Creating user accounts
- Form validation
- Login & Sessions
- Logout
- Middleware (Custom middleware for user authorization)
- Passport
- ironlauncher --auth




ALTERNATIVE (instead of codealong, which can take the whole day):
- prepare a repo  <!-- @todo -->
- app created with Ironlauncher with functionality for auth but bugs
- provide a readme with steps to follow
- students would need to:
  - fix bugs (eg. why the code to render a form is not working)
  - implement extra functionality (eg create user, following instructions)
  - research & understand code (eg. why validation works etc)
- then, explain concepts (eg. login, sessions etc...)
