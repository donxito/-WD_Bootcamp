## Day planning

- Q&A

- Prisma Introduction [2.5]

- (self-guided) Prisma Deployment


## Active Learning


Create an API with Prisma and deploy it on Supabase:

1. Create a backend API with 1 model & all CRUD endpoints.
    - Follow the unit "Prisma | Introduction"

2. Deploy your API 
    - Follow the unit "Prisma | Deployment"
    - Bonus 1: follow the sections "Demo 1" and "Demo 2"

<!-- 

IMPORTANT: for connection type, choose session
(it is mentioned in the students portal but 2/6 students missed that part)
-->


Other bonus ideas:
- implement a second model
- use async/await instead of .then().catch()


<!-- 

@LT: 
- workload is reasonable (at least if the group is motivated)
- can also ask to implement 2nd model (instead of doing it as a bonus)

-->
