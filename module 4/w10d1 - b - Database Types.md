- Includes:
  - Refresh (what is a DB, different types of DBs, relational vs. non-relational, use cases)
  - Relational Databases (tables, relationships etc)


## Relationships

Explain:
  - One to one (1:1)
  - One to many (1:n)
  - Many to many (n:n)


## Primary Key

<!-- @LT: just an intro (we'll see it in more detail later) -->

Each table in a relational database has a primary key column that uniquely identifies each row in that table.


## Foreign key

<!-- @LT: just an intro (we'll see it in more detail later) -->

- A foreign key is used to create a link between two tables.
- It matches a column in one table to the primary key in another table.
- This ensures that the relationship between the tables is valid and consistent.
