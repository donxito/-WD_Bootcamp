## (Bonus) Git Workflows

Some common strategies ("workflows"):

- Trunk-Based Development (TBD)
  - main + develop + feature branches
  - Trunk (main) is deployable at all times. 
  - > In trunk-based development the main branch is assumed to always be stable, without issues, and ready to deploy.

- Git flow:

Note: 
- Those are just some examples.
- Each team/product has different needs and policies.
  - e.g. how code is merged onto the main branch (code review, PR, ...)
