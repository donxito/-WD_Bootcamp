# About

- This document reflects how we're currently organizing ourselves.



##  Lectures

- focus on the fundamentals. Finish early + leave more time for LAB & questions
  - aim to finish lectures 4:30.

- students shouldn't start lab while in lectures (maybe only in m3, since they know themselves better)

- #extra-challenges


##  LAB intros
  - TAs, 1 lab each



## LABs feedback
- Expectations: 1 lab/week
  - note: first week we will try to do more. 
  - questions: ask.
- How: on github, on their PR
- Organization (how we organize ourselfs to check labs)
- Tracking: on control panel spreadsheet + smileys on campus tools



## Work in Pairs (module 2)
- Explain students why it's important
  - Pair programming and collaboration is essential
  - LABs in pairs
    - We rotate, so that studens have the opportunity to work with different ppl (and choose who they prefer to work with for project2)
  - Project2 in pairs
    - We ask students for their preferences

- LAB pairs
  - Rotate for each lab
  - Explain students that it's important to work with different ppl + great opportunity to choose for project2.
  - Remind students to tell us if they feel they're struggling

- Project2 pairs
  - Ask top 5 you want to work with & max. 3 you don't


## Project weeks
- Kata: 9-10am
  - m1: mandatory time
  - m2 & m3: send them the links, they can choose (also: during code freeze).
- Standup: all together (if group not too big)
  - Emphasize --> 1min.
  - 1 fun question
- Independent work
  - one group with each TA
  - If students need support, they can ask on slack (eg. #ask-for-help-during-class)
     


## Project Presentations & feedback
- Spreadsheet with requirments --> TA
- Presentation practice
  - Thursday afternoon (so that TAs can check requirments & give feedback on Thursday)
