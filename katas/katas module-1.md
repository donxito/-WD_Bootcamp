## w3d1: Number of anagrams in an array of words
https://www.codewars.com/kata/587e18b97a25e865530000d8

- Prep.:
  - explain nested for loops

- Time: 1.5h (in pairs, with previous guidance + support)


Hints (Spoiler):
- we need to iterate through the array of words and compare each word with the other words in the array, one by one  --> we need a nested loop

- to compare if a word is an anagram of one other, one option is to extract all the letters and compare
  - eg:
    - boa > abo
    - oab > abo 






## w3d2: Clocky Mc Clock-Face
https://www.codewars.com/kata/clocky-mc-clock-face/javascript

- Prep.:
  - Understand the problem + think together how we can solve it
  - Explain how we can get the time from the angle (explain rule of three)
  - Give 3 steps to follow:
    -- get totalMinutes from angle
    -- get hours and minutes
    -- format

- Time: 1.5h (with previous guidance, some students may be able to solve it in 1h)
