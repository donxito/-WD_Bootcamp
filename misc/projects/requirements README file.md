# README.md for your projects




## Project 1

- Description
  - Brief description of the project
  - You can also add screenshots :) 

- Instructions to play
  - Important: make sure that anyone with the link can play your game (ie. if it is not trivial, include also instructions in the game itself)

- Demo
  - Link to the deployed version of your project (github pages)






## Project 2

- Description 
  - Brief description of the project

- Instructions to run this app in my computer
  - how to install dependencies (`npm install`)
  - environment variables: explain that I'd need to create a `.env` file and add environment variables (remember to detail all the variables that I may need to create, if I need to create an account to get some credentials for cloudinary or an api etc.)
  - how to run the application (eg. `npm run dev`)

- Demo
  - Link to the deployed version of your project (heroku)





## Project 3


For each repo (front/backend), add a readme file with the following:

- Description
  - Brief description of the project 
  - IMPORTANT:
    - Explain very clear if this repo is the Frontend (React) or the backend (Express API).
    - Provide a link to the other repo (ex. "a repository with the backend code can be found here...").


- Instructions to run this app in my computer
  - For example:
    - How to install dependencies (`npm install`)
    - Any environment variables that I may need to add (make sure you include all of them).
    - How to run the application (eg. `npm run dev`, `npm start`, ...)

- Demo
  - Link to the deployed version of your project
  - Provide at least the link to Netlify (you can also provide the link to adaptable/fly.io, so that anyone can test the API).



- (bonus) For the backend, you can document the endpoints that your API implements.
  - Note: this takes time and is not an essential requirement (make sure you focus on the code, keep this as a bonus).
  - Example: https://github.com/Ironborn-Ironhack-March-2022/ironborn-project-management-server/blob/main/README.md
