- Description 
  - Brief description of the project

- Instructions to run this app in my computer
  - do I need environment variables? 
    - explain that I'd need to create a `.env` file and add environment variables (remember to detail all the variables that I may need to create, if I need to create an account to get some credentials for cloudinary or an api etc.)
  - how to install dependencies (`npm install`)
  - how to run the application (eg. `npm run dev`)

- Demo

## Project 3

We have 2 repos, add one readme file for each repo.


- Description
  - Brief description of the project 
  - IMPORTANT:
    - Explain very clear if this repo is the Frontend (React) or the backend (Express API).
    - Provide a link to the other repo (ex. "a repository with the backend code can be found here...").


- Instructions to run this app in my computer
  - for example:
    - how to install dependencies (`npm install`)
    - any environment variables that I may need to add (make sure you include all of them).
    - how to run the application (eg. `npm run dev`, `npm start`, ...)


- (bonus) For the backend, you can document the endpoints that your API implements.
  - note: this takes a bit of time (make sure you focus on the code, keep this as a bonus).
  - example: https://github.com/Ironborn-Ironhack-March-2022/ironborn-project-management-server/blob/main/README.md


- Demo
  - Link to the deployed version of your project.
  - Provide at least the link to Netlify (you can also provide the link to heroku, so that users can test the API).
