# Project preferences


```js
const myPreferences = {
    iWantToWorkwith: ["alice", "bob", "charly", "david", "elisabeth", "frank", "george"], // at least 7 names, ordered by preference
    iPreferToAvoid: ["", ""] // max 3 names
}

```


Notes: 
- in your preferences, do not include ppl that you feel have a very different level than you.
- DEADLINE: tomorrow 10am

  
IMPORTANT: 
- If we ask any student to do project individual, tell them asap 
- In some cases, this is also an option:
  - inform them in advance
  - ask them to still submit their preferences 
  - assess with the team (based on their preferences)



## How we currently work

- we use a form (google forms)
  - example: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ji6OTC6T_N3nmr28kbELvnSAfuKjklq95yFhuzzh8SU/edit
- we export responses to spreadsheet
- and we upload the data to cleavergroups (see below)



## Some tools / things to try


Tools (automatic groups): 
- https://clevergroups.com/tryit.php
- https://github.com/A-Fitz/Group-Generator

Or implement ourselves:

## clevergroups.com

Allows students to enter data themselves but it's not a great option.


If we ask students to fill in they preferences by themselves...
- "Teacher" just create the group and share link
Students needs to create account with their names and join the group
- Only when all of them are in, they’d be able to choose between all students, and only who they wanna work with. - This means we should wait for all of them to join the group, and then ask again to fill the preferences.
- They are not allow to fill who they don’t wanna work with, so they should still text us anyway (Only teacher can do that manually)
