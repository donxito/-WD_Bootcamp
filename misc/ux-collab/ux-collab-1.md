# UX-WD Collab 1 (ux students help wd)

<!--

Notes (feb22):
- wd students were asked to produce wireframes in advance (on https://whimsical.com/).
- on Monday, UX students were joining us and giving feedback based on those wireframes.
- activity was 1.5h (project2 is in pairs, in most cases we had 2wd + 2ux)
- we saw that some groups were doing amazing and taking the opportunity to learn from UX people BUT some other groups were not very efficient.

- TAKEOVER: ask ux TAs to produce a list of tasks to go through & some bonus tasks
