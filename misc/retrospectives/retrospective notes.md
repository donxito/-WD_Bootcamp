# Retrospectives


## When

- I always do one retro at the end of week1
  (this gives us a lot of valuable information)

- This is usually the only retro we do. The rest of the bootcamp we gather verbal feedback.


## Setup

- We use one of those:
  - https://app.mural.co (more flexible)
  - https://www.goretro.ai/ (more simple)
    - july24: for GoRetro.ai, you need to create an account but there's no email validation.

  <!-- 
  
  @LT: 
  - may be better to add columns one by one
    - What went well ?
    - What can be improved ?
    - Suggestions / Things to try
    - Kudos

  - limit votes: 10. (or tell them one vote per card)

  -->


- On there, we add 4 "feedback" frameworks to gather feedback in the following categories:

  - Ironhack & the bootcamp
    - Includes: Admissions, PM, Materials, LABs, Central Support...
  - Instruction team (LT + TAs)
    - Lectures, LT, TAs, classes in general ...
  - Class (we, as a group)
  - Yourself (self-assessment)
  - (extra) Gratitude Corner
