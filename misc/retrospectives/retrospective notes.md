# Retrospectives


## When

- I always do one retro at the end of week1
  (this gives us a lot of valuable information)

- This is usually the only retro we do. The rest of the bootcamp we gather verbal feedback.


## Setup

- We use https://app.mural.co/

- On there, we add 4 "feedback" frameworks to gather feedback in the following categories:

  - Ironhack & the bootcamp
    - Includes: Admissions, PM, Materials, LABs, Central Support...
  - Instruction team (LT + TAs)
    - Lectures, LT, TAs, classes in general ...
  - Class (we, as a group)
  - Yourself (self-assessment)
  - (extra) Gratitude Corner
