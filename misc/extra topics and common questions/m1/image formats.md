# Image formats


Some common image formats:

- .jpg & .jpeg
  - compressed (great for photography)

- .png
  - great for digital designs (logos, icons, etc)

- .svg
  - great for digital designs (logos, icons, etc). 
  - SVG is scallable
  - it is defined with some code similar to html and can even be manipulated with JavaScript.

- .webp
  - alternative to .jpg and .png (but don't use for high quality images)


- .gif
  - avoid for websites -only for memes ;)

# File size guidelines for images


Note: this is very subjective & depends on each situation but, as a guideline:

- below 100kb: ok
- 100kb - 500kb: ok if you need some quality
- 500kb - 2MB: only for high quality images
- larger than 4-5MB: probably avoid
