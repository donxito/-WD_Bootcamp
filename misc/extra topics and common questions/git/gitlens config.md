# GitLens VS Code extension config

This is the configuration that I currently have:


- Disable:
  - "Git CodeLens"
  - "Hovers"
  - "Current Line Blame"

- Views: choose "GitLens layout" (ie. Source Control panel will look as per default & all the functionality of GitLens will be displayed on its own panel)
