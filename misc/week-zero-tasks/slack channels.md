## Ask the class pinned message:

Do you have any question related to code or technical challenges? Ask on this channel.

Why?
- TAs/LT may not have availability to answer your questions
- Other Students may be having the same issue

How to ask?
- Before you post a message, make sure you've used your own resources (eg. google, re-think the problem, write some code and see what happens...)
- Write a clear explanation of the problem
- Write a clear question (eg. what I am trying to do)
- IMPORTANT: Provide code, so that others can test/play with the code (make it easy for others to help you!)

Answering:
- Answering is great: it helps other students but it can also help yourself (finding bugs in the code from other people is essential for any developer + when we try to explain why something is not working we're forced to really understand a problem)
- Answer on the same thread of the original question (so that we keep everything more organized)
