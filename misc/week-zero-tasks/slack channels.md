## How to add all workspace members to channels.

0. Create the channels.

1. Configure workspace default channels (so that new members are automatically added to those channels).

2. To add all existing members:
  - To get a list of members type `/who` (for example, in the general channel)
  - Copy that list & paste when adding new members.




## channels


These are the channels we create on our slack workspace.

  - pinned message: (see below)

## Ask the class pinned message:

Do you have any question related to the course, code or technical challenges? You can always ask on this channel.

Why/when:
- If you think other students may be having the same question.
- or, outside of support hours
- or, when the team is too busy to provide support (TAs/LTs may not have availability to answer your questions but other students may be able to help).

How to ask good technical questions:
- Before you post a message, make sure you've used your own resources (ex. google, take a short break, re-think the problem, write some code and see what happens...)
- Write a clear explanation of the problem
- Write a clear question (eg. what I am trying to do)
- IMPORTANT: Provide code, so that others can test/play with the code (make it easy for others to help you!)

Answering:
- Answering is great. It helps other classmates but it can also help yourself (finding bugs in the code from other people is an essential skill for any developer + when we try to explain why something is not working we're forced to really understand a problem)
- Please, answer on the same thread of the original question (so that we keep everything more organized)
