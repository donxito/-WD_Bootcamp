# Changes on Studio for all cohorts


## Intro

I usually apply all those changes on the students portal for all cohorts.



<!-- @LT: check unit "What's new"  -->
<!-- @todo: record video for self-guided "DayZero & installations"  -->


## Module 0: Tips & tricks for success


I usually remove those:
- ![EXTRA] Link to  the GitHub class organization
- ![EXTRA] No class dates
- ![EXTRA] Upcoming events


Edit:
- [EXTRA] Guidelines on how to submit the labs → update cohort name
- Contacts → update details (can copy html table from prev. cohorts)
- Career Services → remove OR add Career Week dates
- m1 + m2 + m3 "Requirements for win-win"
  - Update LABs requirements ("LABs: submit at least 80% labs")



## All modules (1, 2, 3)

Remove:
- Project feedback (w3d5 + w6d5) (we usually do this during presentation practice sessions)



## Module 1

- w1d1: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] Check installations"
  - > During this activity, we will check if all of us have the main tools and software that we will be using during the bootcamp.

- w1d1: "Problem Solving and Support" - [SELF_GUIDED] 
  - Ask the teaching team for help


- w1d3: "JS | Numbers - Advanced Topics" - [SELF_GUIDED] 

- w1d4: seems quite a bit of workload & 2 labs
  - move both labs to the end of the day.
  - "LAB JavaScript Clue" - mark as extra
  - "JS | Arrays & Objects" (nested data structures) - can be done "self guided"
  


- w1d5: "JS | OOP - Function constructor vs. Class" -- remove

- w1d5: add week1 retro (there's already a unit, just need to unhide it)

- w1d5: create "[EVENT] Icebreakers"
  - note: if possible, invite students from previous cohort.

- w1d5: "JS | Special keyword - this" 
  - Extra (at that time we haven't even covered arrow functions)

- w1d5: "JS | Debugging and Error Handling" 
  - Extra (interesting for advanced students)




- w2d4: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] OOP Game Codealong"
  - > Class codealong: we will create together a game using OOP and DOM manipulation.



<!-- @LT: schedule reminder to check m2 installations -->



## Module 2


- w4d1: add unit "Intro to module 2"
  > During this session, we will do a quick intro to module 2 (what we will learn + how we will work to achieve those goals).

- w5d1 "Mongoose&Express | Update - Delete documents" - [SELF_GUIDED]


- w5d1 "LAB | Express Drones"

- w6d1: cloudinary --extra

## Module 3

- w7d1: add unit "Do I feel ready?"
  > In this session we will analyze and discuss, what  you already have to start working as a Junior Developer & what you feel you still need. 
  > We will also discuss about the impostor syndrome, something that will probably be with you during your entire career as a developer.
  > You can also find a few tips to beat the impostor syndrome here: https://impostorsyndrome.com/10-steps-overcome-impostor/


- w7d1: add unit "[SELF_GUIDED] Getting Familiar with React"
  - Add activity so that students get familiar with React (watch intro video, before we start m3)

- w7d1: add unit "Intro to module 3"
  > During this session, we will do a quick intro to module 3 (what we will learn + how we will work to achieve those goals).

- w8d2: "React | Token-Based Authentication II (Frontend)" - [SELF_GUIDED]

- w8d2: "React | Organizing HTTP Requests" - [SELF_GUIDED]


<!-- 

  Frontend auth:
  - option 1: self guided
      - we can kick-off project earlier
      - students usuall say everything is clear but then seem to struggle with those concepts.
  - option 2: demo in class
      - it can well take a whole day
  - option 3: record a video so that they can follow the video self-guided.

## Other changes

- Add Careers Workshop Sessions

- Consider: setting DL for assessments (as part of the title for each assessment)
  - e.g. "NodeJS and MongoDB CRUD app (202109) [Deadline: by Friday 9am]"
  

- Define LAB/assessment planning & share with students, at the beginning of each week.
  (e.g. which labs are individual/in pairs)


  <!-- 

  Slack (schedule):


  @here

  FYI: 

  - Tomorrow 9am there's Career Services workshop (for those of you taking part in Career Week, you'll have received an email or invitation with the details).
  
  - We meet in our class at 10am (if the workshop finishes earlier just take a break ;) )
