# Changes on Studio for all cohorts


## Intro

I usually apply all those changes on the students portal for all cohorts.





## Module 0: Tips & tricks for success


I usually remove those:
- ![EXTRA] Link to  the GitHub class organization
- ![EXTRA] No class dates
- ![EXTRA] Upcoming events


Edit:
- [EXTRA] Guidelines on how to submit the labs --> update cohort name
- Contacts --> update details (or just remove it)
- Career Services --> add Career Week dates
- [EXTRA] Technical interview prep --> move to end


## Module 1

- w2d1: make one of the 2 css labs extra
- w2d2: extra: "LAB | JavaScript Advanced Algorithms"

- w2d2: move "OOP assessment" to w2d3

- w2d4 & w2d5: mark Canvas units as "extra"? (I usually build a dom-based game instead)


## Module 2

- w4d2: LAB | Intro Node > [EXTRA] (or just remove it)

- w4d3: LAB | MongoDB - Advanced Querying > [EXTRA] 

- w4d3: too much content. Move some of the lessons to d4.
  - MongoDB | Data Models
  - MongoDB | Indexing & Aggregation Framework

- w5d4: check those here (labs and lectures)


## Module 3 (OLD curriculum)

w7d1:
- React | Intro to React - Create React app from the scratch  > [SELF_GUIDED] 
- LAB | Hello Ironhack > [SELF_GUIDED] (Bonus)

w7d2:
- Bonus: LAB | Bulma > [SELF_GUIDED] (Bonus)


w8: auth lessons & project kick-off: move to next day


## Module 3 (NEW curriculum)

- w7d1: add unit "Do I feel ready?"
- w7d1: add unit "Intro to module 3"

> In this session we will analyze and discuss, what  you already have to start working as a Junior Developer & what you feel you still need. 

We will also discuss about the impostor syndrome, something that will probably be with you during your entire career as a developer.

You can also find a few tips to beat the impostor syndrome here: https://impostorsyndrome.com/10-steps-overcome-impostor/

- w7d1: "LAB | Hello React" (remove)

- w8d1: "[EXTRA] Assessment review - React Fundamentals 1" (remove)
- w8d3: "[EXTRA] Assessment review - React Fundamentals 2" (remove)
  <!-- students receive solutions + they can ask specific questions -->



- "React - Token-Based Authentication II (Frontend)"
  - move it to next day (it can well take a whole day)
