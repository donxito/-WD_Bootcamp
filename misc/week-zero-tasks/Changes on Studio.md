# Changes on Studio for all cohorts


## Intro

I usually apply all those changes on the students portal for all cohorts.





## Module 0: Tips & tricks for success


I usually remove those:
- ![EXTRA] Link to  the GitHub class organization
- ![EXTRA] No class dates
- ![EXTRA] Upcoming events


Edit:
- [EXTRA] Guidelines on how to submit the labs → update cohort name
- Contacts → update details
- Career Services → add Career Week dates
- [EXTRA] Technical interview prep - move to week 10 materials



## All modules (1, 2, 3)

Remove:
- Project feedback (we usually do this during presentation practice sessions)



## Module 1

- w1d1: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] Check installations"
  - > During this activity, we will check if all of us have the main tools and software that we will be using during the bootcamp.

- w1d5: "JS | Special keyword - this" -- extra (instead of self guided) ?

- w1d4: seems quite a bit of workload & 2 labs
  - posible solution: move some contents to d3 and/or mark as self guided ?

- w1d5: add week1 retro?

- w1d5: "JS | OOP - Function constructor vs. Class" -- remove

- w2d4: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] OOP Game Codealong"
  - > Class codealong: we will create together a game using OOP and DOM manipulation.

- Canvas (w2d4 & w2d5)
  - Mark all as extra (we usually build a dom-based game instead)
  - Move the Assessment to beginning of w2d4.
  - Put all canvas units at the end of w2d4.



## Module 2


- w4d1: add unit "Intro to module 2"



## Module 3 (NEW curriculum)

- w7d1: add unit "Do I feel ready?"
  > In this session we will analyze and discuss, what  you already have to start working as a Junior Developer & what you feel you still need. 
  > We will also discuss about the impostor syndrome, something that will probably be with you during your entire career as a developer.
  > You can also find a few tips to beat the impostor syndrome here: https://impostorsyndrome.com/10-steps-overcome-impostor/


- w7d1: add unit "Intro to module 3"

- w7d1: "LAB | Hello React" -- remove

- w7d2: "LAB | React training [steps 1-7]" -- move to w7d1 + mark as "extra"


- w8d1 "[EXTRA] Assessment review - React Fundamentals 1" (most students perform well + they will receive solutions + if they have questions they can ask)

- w8d3 "[EXTRA] Assessment review - React Fundamentals 2" (most students perform well + they will receive solutions + if they have questions they can ask)


- w8d2: 
- "React - Token-Based Authentication II (Frontend)" -- move it to next day (it can well take a whole day)
- "Project #3 Guidelines: MERN Web Application"


Update:
- "Project #3 Guidelines: MERN Web Application"
  - Rubrics: "use them as a guideline"
