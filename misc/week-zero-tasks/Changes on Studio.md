# Changes on Studio for all cohorts


## Intro

I usually apply all those changes on the students portal for all cohorts.



<!-- @Luis: check unit "What's new"  -->


## Module 0: Tips & tricks for success


I usually remove those:
- ![EXTRA] Link to  the GitHub class organization
- ![EXTRA] No class dates
- ![EXTRA] Upcoming events


Edit:
- [EXTRA] Guidelines on how to submit the labs → update cohort name
- Contacts → update details (can copy html table from prev. cohorts)
- Career Services → remove OR add Career Week dates
- m1 + m2 + m3 "Requirements for win-win"
  - Update LABs requirements ("LABs: submit at least 80% labs")



## All modules (1, 2, 3)

Remove:
- Project feedback (w3d5 + w6d5) (we usually do this during presentation practice sessions)



## Module 1

- w1d1: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] Check installations"
  - > During this activity, we will check if all of us have the main tools and software that we will be using during the bootcamp.

- "JS | Numbers - Advanced Topics" - [SELF_GUIDED] 

- w1d4: seems quite a bit of workload & 2 labs
  - move both labs to the end of the day.
  - "LAB JavaScript Clue" - mark as extra
  - "JS | Arrays & Objects" (nested data structures) - if needed, can be done "self guided"
  


- w1d5: "JS | OOP - Function constructor vs. Class" -- remove

- w1d5: add week1 retro (there's already a unit, just need to unhide it)

- w1d5: create "[EVENT] Icebreakers"
  - note: if possible, invite students from previous cohort.

- w1d5: "JS | Special keyword - this" 
  - Extra (at that time we haven't even covered arrow functions)

- w1d5: "JS | Debugging and Error Handling" 
  - Extra (interesting for advanced students)





- w2d4: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] OOP Game Codealong"
  - > Class codealong: we will create together a game using OOP and DOM manipulation.

- Canvas (w2d4 & w2d5)
  - Mark all as extra (we usually build a dom-based game instead)
  - Move the Assessment to beginning of w2d4.
  - Put all canvas units at the end of w2d4.

<!-- @Luis: schedule reminder to check m2 installations -->



## Module 2



<!--
@Luis - m2 planning: 
"\misc\feedback - curriculum and students portal\sept22 - mercury schedule m2"

-->


- w4d1: add unit "Intro to module 2"
  > During this session, we will do a quick intro to module 2 (what we will learn + how we will work to achieve those goals).

- w4d1: add unit "JS | Object and array destructuring"
  > In this unit, we will learn how to use JS Object and Array destructuring.


- "JS | Destructuring Assignment and Parameter Handling" (w4d5)
  - move to w4d2

- w4d4: "MongoDB | Indexing & Aggregation Framework" -- remove
- w4d5: "Node | Asynchrony" -- remove


- w5d1 "LAB | Express Drones"

- w6d1: cloudinary --extra




## Module 3

- w7d1: add unit "Do I feel ready?"
  > In this session we will analyze and discuss, what  you already have to start working as a Junior Developer & what you feel you still need. 
  > We will also discuss about the impostor syndrome, something that will probably be with you during your entire career as a developer.
  > You can also find a few tips to beat the impostor syndrome here: https://impostorsyndrome.com/10-steps-overcome-impostor/
