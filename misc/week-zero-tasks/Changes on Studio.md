# Changes on Studio for all cohorts


## Intro

I usually apply all those changes on the students portal for all cohorts.



<!-- @Luis: check unit "What's new"  -->


## Module 0: Tips & tricks for success


I usually remove those:
- ![EXTRA] Link to  the GitHub class organization
- ![EXTRA] No class dates
- ![EXTRA] Upcoming events


Edit:
- [EXTRA] Guidelines on how to submit the labs → update cohort name
- Contacts → update details (can copy html table from prev. cohorts)
- Career Services → remove OR add Career Week dates
- [EXTRA] Technical interview prep - move to week 10 materials



## All modules (1, 2, 3)

Remove:
- Project feedback (we usually do this during presentation practice sessions)



## Module 1

- w1d1: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] Check installations"
  - > During this activity, we will check if all of us have the main tools and software that we will be using during the bootcamp.

- w1d4: seems quite a bit of workload & 2 labs
  - move both labs to the end of the day.
  - "LAB JavaScript Clue" - mark as extra
  - "JS | Arrays & Objects" (nested data structures) - if needed, can be done "self guided"
  


- w1d5: "JS | OOP - Function constructor vs. Class" -- remove

- w1d5: add week1 retro (there's already a unit, just need to unhide it)

- w1d5: "JS | Special keyword - this" 
  - Extra (at that time we haven't even covered arrow functions)

- w1d5: "JS | Debugging and Error Handling" 
  - Extra (interesting for advanced students)




- w2d4: add "[CLASS_ACTIVITY] OOP Game Codealong"
  - > Class codealong: we will create together a game using OOP and DOM manipulation.

- Canvas (w2d4 & w2d5)
  - Mark all as extra (we usually build a dom-based game instead)
  - Move the Assessment to beginning of w2d4.
  - Put all canvas units at the end of w2d4.

<!-- @Luis: schedule reminder to check m2 installations -->

## Module 2


- w4d1: add unit "Intro to module 2"

- w5d5: 
  - LAB "Express basic auth" -- remove
  - Asssessment "NodeJS and MongoDB CRUD app (202109)" -- move to w5d3 (after auth)

- w6d1: cloudinary --self-guided


<!--
@Luis - m2 planning: 
"\misc\feedback - curriculum and students portal\sept22 - mercury schedule m2"

- note: "LAB | Express Drones" - need to configure as assignment + mark with "Required: False" (so that it appears in CT)

-->


## Module 3 (NEW curriculum)

- w7d1: add unit "Do I feel ready?"
  > In this session we will analyze and discuss, what  you already have to start working as a Junior Developer & what you feel you still need. 
  > We will also discuss about the impostor syndrome, something that will probably be with you during your entire career as a developer.
  > You can also find a few tips to beat the impostor syndrome here: https://impostorsyndrome.com/10-steps-overcome-impostor/


- w7d1: add unit "Intro to module 3"

- w7d1: "LAB | Hello React" -- remove

- "LAB | React training" (w7d2) -- split in two & mark both of them as "extra"
    - "LAB | React training [steps 1-7]" -- w7d1 + "EXTRA"
    - "LAB | React training [steps 8-16]" -- w7d2 + "EXTRA"



- w7d3: "LAB | Thinking in React" -- mark as "extra"
  - note: another alternative is to mark "IronNutrition" as "extra"


- w8d1 "[EXTRA] Assessment review - React Fundamentals 1" (most students perform well + they will receive solutions + if they have questions they can ask)

- w8d3 "[EXTRA] Assessment review - React Fundamentals 2" (most students perform well + they will receive solutions + if they have questions they can ask)


- w8d1 "Integrating the React App" - Self-guided (or provide a video)


- w8d2 Context API --self guided + move to w8d1 (as task to do in the evening)


- w8d2: 
- "React - Token-Based Authentication II (Frontend)" -- move it to next day (it can well take a whole day)
- "Project #3 Guidelines: MERN Web Application"


Update:
- "Project #3 Guidelines: MERN Web Application"
  - Rubrics: "use them as a guideline"
