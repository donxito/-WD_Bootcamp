# Extra - GitHub Copilot



## Demo:

- url: https://github.com/features/copilot/plans 

- settings
    - eg: enable/disable
    - choosing model

- ghost text:
    - `function findLongestStringInArray(){}`
    - `const words = []`

- code suggestions from comments
    - `// function to find the average in an array of numbers`
    - `// GET /drinks`

- questions from comments (note: comment depends on current language):
    - `// q: how do i uninstall an npm package`

- inline chat and speech-to-text
    - note: now it's available in the copilot menu (at the top)
    - example 1: create a function that takes two arrays and returns true if they have exactly the same values
    - example 2: make this function generic, so that it works with any nested levels (ie. arrays of any depth).

- chat in sidebar:
    - `@workspace` (e.g.: how many models we have)
    - `@vscode` (e.g.: whats the shortcut to change the language mode for the current file)

- sparkles (e.g. commit message)


## (skip) Advanced:
- custom instructions (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)


## Tips:

- Copilot can be really good at doing things with existing libraries and apis (especially if they're popular & not very recent)
    - e.g.: `// get most popular artists from spotify api`

## Other AI tools

- UI generators: v0.dev (react, tailwind)
- Low-code development & prototyping: 
    - bolt.new
    - lovable.dev
    - firebase.studio (tried it in april 25, a few days after release, and results were quite poor)

Examples:
- create an Instant Resume Analyzer
- create the homepage for a furniture company that offers beautiful pieces of furniture and shipping everywhere in Germany
- create a REST API with Express and PostgreSQL. API should implement auth functionality with jwt, CRUD on projects and CR on tasks.
- Create a react app to generate random pairs with students. The app will let you create a cohort & add a list of students for that cohort (by entering all the names in comma separated format). Once you have created a cohort, you can generate random pairs (if there's an odd number of students, it will generate a group of 3). If you like the pairs generated, you can click a button to confirm. One you confirm, those pairs will be added to a "pairs history". The user can visit the pairs history to see a table with all the students that have already been matched together. Also, when you create new random pairs, the app will avoid pairing students that have already worked together.

Use cases:
- Quick prototypes.


## WARNINGS ⚠️ 
- As you can see, to be a prompt engineer, one "must" know how to code.
- Using AI to find quick solutions vs. learning
    - If you're learning a new technology, make sure you type things
    - "You will not learn a language by using Google Translator"
