# Extra - GitHub Copilot



## Demo:

- url: https://github.com/features/copilot/plans 

- settings
    - ex: enable/disable

- ghost text:
    - `function findLongestStringInArray(){}`
    - `const words = []`

- code suggestions from comments
    - `// function to find longest string in array`

- questions from comments (note: comment depends on current language):
    - `// q: how do i uninstall an npm package`

- inline chat and speech-to-text
    - ex1: create a function that takes two arrays and returns true if they have exactly the same values
    - ex2: make this function generic, so that it works with any nested levels (ie. arrays of any depth).

- chat in sidebar:
    - `@workspace`
    - `@vscode` (ex. whats the shortcut to change the language mode for the current file)

- sparkles (ex. commit message)


## Tips:

- Copilot can be really good at doing things with existing libraries and apis (especially if they're popular & not very recent)
    - ex. `// get most popular artists from spotify api`


## WARNINGS ⚠️ 
- As you can see, to be a prompt engineer, one "must" know how to code.
- Using AI to find quick solutions vs. learning
    - If you're learning a new technology, make sure you type things
    - "You will not learn a language by using Google Translator"
